true	could we have a se for recommendations in a perfect world the so-important advice do not reinvent the wheel would be extensively followed in practice everyday millions of wheels are reinvented simply because someone did know an existing solution for a specific problem the best way to find a library today is googling it but it 's not always obvious which keywords to use the lack of a tool for finding solutions is very counterproductive for the dev world as a whole stack overflow is not very receptive for recommendation threads so what about a new se for it	where does one post questions like what are good practices on file structure on websites what are the best web hosts price and quality what is the better or php what is easier to learn does displaying a copyright notice on its own protect you or do you need to go through the government the more open ended but generally standardized ones there are many stack exchange sites and i am just wondering what one if it exists would be best i have learned that stack overflow is not the place for this type of questions
true	so chat why is it that only members of stack overflow with at least 20 reputation may talk i want to setup a chatroom for online students learning html css js i encourage everyone learning programming to get a stackoverflow account for stack overflow chat is brilliant but unfortunatly new members ca participate right away the ability to talk is only available once a member has 20 reputation why to reduce spambots does not seem like a solid enough reason stack overflow and stack overflow chat have community driven moderation also all stack overflow registrations already make members jump through the spambot filter hoops email confirmations captchas we would do restrict the posting of questions on stack overflow to 20 reputation members so why limit chat it 's the new that really need the ability to talk to other members many are ready to formulate a question or knowledgable enough to commit themselves to an answer so getting that 20 reputation takes time considering the cost on new users is the restriction really necessary	newbie does have enough reputation to talk in chat possible duplicate so chat why is it that only members of stack overflow with at least 20 reputation may talk i just tried the new feature to move a conversation to chat and got the message indicated in the title the whole reason the comment chain got so chatty is because this is an inexperienced person who does quite get it and is likely to get a lot of reputation any time soon is this exactly the sort of conversation that should be taken off-line i think if someone is invited to a chat by someone with enough reputation it should matter what their own reputation is they should be allowed into the chat
true	close as duplicate what if only the answer is a duplicate i know it 's already established that duplicate questions should be closed but not deleted so they can act as pointers to the one canonical answer however i think there 's one important aspect that is usually glossed over lately i 've run into a number of instances where questions have been closed as duplicates even though they patently are not instead those answering the question know that the answer is a duplicate of one presented and to save them the trouble of copying that answer they close the question as a duplicate at the most basic level this is of course absurd many entirely different questions can have the same answer would you close what is 2 and what is the square root of 16 as duplicates but of course most real-world examples are as clear cut i feel that a really good example of what i 'm talking about is this question which was closed as a duplicate of the somewhat contentious faq question here in this case the questions are genuinely different one question is simply why does my code work and the other is when should i use typename to make my code compile of course the answer is you should use typename here to make your code work so the answer is the same but the question is from the user 's point of view it seems to send the wrong message when such a question is closed as a duplicate does this come across as i ca be bothered answering your question but here 's a link to a generic cookie-cutter answer that might answer your question oh and in the future please do ask questions here it 's already been done i think it 's important to note that the questions are so different that the person asking might not realize the relevance of the question he is being directed to this is just a case of two people asking the same thing with slightly different wording but two entirely different questions where the answer just happens to overlap heavily it is also my understanding that dupe questions are deleted after a while which of course means that all the effort that goes into marking such questions as dupes to avoid answering them is really just generating more work for these people as i see it there are two ways to look at this problem the close as duplicate text does actually match what 's happening the first part this question covers exactly the same ground as earlier questions on this topic is simply untrue the second part its answers may be merged with another identical question seems to threaten that the question may be eliminated which would be actively harmful whether or not this merger ever does happen is almost irrelevant what i 'm concerned with is the message it sends to the person asking or the question probably should be closed as a duplicate at all regardless of how you word it the question is unique its answer just happens to overlap those for another question so what should be done in this case some of these ideas are just user policy others would require new functionality to implemented leave everything as it is and close the questions as duplicate when the answer is the same as that to another question we could leave such questions open and just answer them again the textual description on close as duplicate could be revised to better cover these cases and of course the question being closed should never be deleted then a new close reason could be created instead a duplicate answer to complement the existing duplicate question close reason which might make more sense to the op whose question got closed or we could try to streamline and automate the process of duplicating answers so that actually answering these questions is such a chore think of it as refactoring tools applied to answers to elaborate on the last item the problem with duplicate answers is usually that we have to stop writing our answer and go search out that other question which has an answer we can link to and then someone else provides a less informative but quicker answer and we do get any rep and sit in a corner sulking for the next week what if we could factor out commonly used nuggets of information from our answers store them in some kind of wiki-like repository or the usual format could work too as long as it is made easy for us to reference so that we can reference it easily when writing answers that rely on this information in the example i linked to above what i really want to do is just provide a simple answer shell containing a bit of context which relates the information to the op 's problem and then for the meat of the answer i 'd just like to reference some extremely commonly used information and i 'd like to be able to do so quickly without having to search and without having to type out an entire url what i really want is to write an answer such as this you need to use the typename keyword as described here wiki typename and then have the here transform into a link to the currently fictive so-wiki article on the typename keyword in or even better it could expand into an inline copy of that article making it easier and more convenient for the reader of the answer while still allowing us to reuse things we already wrote and allowing us to centrally keep this information nugget up to date thoughts how much of a problem do you think this is and how do you think it should be dealt with	what constitutes a duplicate question in particular is a question a duplicate if the answer is contained in another question possible duplicate close as duplicate what if only the answer is a duplicate i have just asked a question on so why does casting a function to a function type that is identical except for return type fail  one user commented that it might be an exact duplicate of another question is the return type part of the function signature and presumably voted to close it on this basis as well i pointed out in a following comment that my question was distinctly different and the response in a following comment was if you read the answer i referred to you 'll see that it explicitly answers your question it seems odd to me that a question would be marked as an exact duplicate if the answer to that question is contained within the answer to a different question even if the questions themselves are different when i asked about this a different commenter stated it 's a duplicate if the answers to the other question would equally apply here again it seems strange to me that the category exact duplicate should apply even if the question is different for example how should i or anyone in the future know to look at a different question for an answer to their question it seems to me that if a different question has an applicable answer then the question itself should not be considered an exact duplicate but rather a good answer to the question would be either to link to the answer in the second question to repeat or the relevant information from the answer to the second question or both i looked at the stackoverflow faq for guidance it says exact duplicate this question covers exactly the same content as earlier questions on this topic its answers may be merged with another identical question this strikes me as possibly ambiguous but fairly clearly indicates that it is the content of the question not the content of the answers that distinguishes exactly duplicated questions i would like to gain clarity on the possibly ambiguous definition of exact duplicate specifically does exact duplicate mean that the content of the question itself is an exact duplicate of the content of another question regardless of answers to the questions or is it possible for a question to be an exact duplicate if the answer to another question contains the answer to the original question if in fact a question is considered an exact duplicate if the answer to it is contained in the answer to a different question then i would like to understand the rationale behind this decision given that people browsing or googling in the future will not have good reason to look at a given question if it is not the same question they have in my case i did see the linked question before i asked mine but i did not look at it because i already knew the answer so this is a case in point in this case the answer to my question is partially contained in the answer to the linked question only because the person who composed that answer went above and beyond the call of duty to compose a thorough wiki-style essay that not only answered the specific question but also touched on other areas as well that seems like a good reason to link to that answer in the answer to my question not to mark my question as an exact duplicate
true	i was able to review while blocked as the title suggests i am blocked for 7 days for reviewing the posts today when i clicked on the counter for reviews i do know the exact name for that i was able to review the content i reviewed 2 posts and responded as needed here is the thing i was able to review even while blocked for being stupid while reviewing was it a bug or something else it happened just a bit ago there are the reviews that i did just an hour ago when i clicked the same link it reminded me that i am not able to review posts for 3 days more 7 was the real count i have no idea if this was a bug can anyone tell me	i was able to review audits even though i was suspended from doing so i got review banned for 7 days on march 3rd 2014 i have the habit to click on review whenever i am on stack overflow 's page yesterday it was showing me the following regular message you have failed too many recent review audits looks like you might need a break come back in 4 days to continue reviewing so there were 4 days left of my review ban but this morning when i click on the review link it allowed me to perform a review you can see my review history i double checked all the reviews there is any failure in today 's reviews now again when i click on review again it shows me same message as before but with a 3 day warning you have failed too many recent review audits looks like you might need a break come back in 3 days to continue reviewing first i thought that it was because of some of my helpful flags that my review ban is lifted automatically by the system but now i think that this is a bug in the system it should allow me to review for the next 3 days update this issue is re-produced with me just before few minutes i have notice one thing that this happens only one time meaning after ban this happens one time only and once it happens it doesnt happens again till the ban period is over
true	which badges do not cause a notification for experienced users yesterday i have received two badges revival and self-learner however i was only notified of the revival badge because apparently the self-learner badge is not considered veteran-worthy what badges have their notification suppressed if the user has a 200-rep account somewhere on the stack exchange network	missing badge notifications for badges earned on other sites some times i notice i have a new badge by the number in the header but there is no notification you 've earned x badge see it in your profile over time i got the impression that this happens only for badges i already have on so for example i 've earned citizen patrol but there was no notification for this but when i earned nice answer there was clear notification for it since i did earn this at so is it the case or something wrong with me if it 's the case why

true	adding a new user to a chat room access list is confusing there was considerable confusion in chat recently about this dialog and when i looked at it i realized it 's misleading if not downright wrong it makes it sound like you can enter a user 's site id or site profile url to add them directly to a chat 's acl but you ca the first field expects a chat id or a chat profile url i 'm not sure why the second field says if they have already visited before both fields have that requirement the ideal solution would be to change the first field so a site profile link works automatically creating the chat account if necessary and then adding the chat account to the access list this also solves the problem of having no good way to find a user 's chat account given their site account you currently need to search for their display name on chat and page through the results until you spot their gravatar since the dialog 's text changes when a moderator is looking at it it seems like this was the intended functionality and it 's just not working right if that 's too hard the dialog should at least be rewritten to clarify that the first field is for chat links only not site links it would also be nice if giving it invalid input caused an error right now it just silently closes the dialog	allow moderators to add a user to a chat room by knowing their site ids currently if one wants to give a user special access to a room one must know the users chat id as a moderator i can easily create a chat user for someone who does have one via superping but i ca find it easily as mentioned in the update on the question i linked to one needs to know the chat id to provide access this is rather cumbersome to do when you do know the chat id but do know an se profile i propose this in the grant user access area allow the profile to be entered in form as well as the standard user id if this will lead to rather heavy queries at least let work in most cases you already know the parent user when you use the superping or can make a good guess the user has only a few accounts

true	responding to your too localized concerns as part of our closing overhaul we 've moved reorganized and renamed a number of close reasons including too localized while that change was informed both by widespread misuse of the reason and numerous meta posts from you many of you have also indicated concerns about its new home in the off-topic menu and when you 're concerned we usually are too so we wanted to provide a little more background and more importantly set up a place where you can share any gaps you 're finding once the changes roll out network wide tl dr if you find examples that tl used to cover but that ca be addressed by the new off-topic reasons post them as answers here if you want more background on why something needed to be changed read the large number of words below did tl clear out many bad questions sort of it definitely helped us eliminate some bad questions and we need to make sure we deal with those but it was the least frequently used close reason a recent sample found it used on roughly of total questions asked on stack overflow with similar network stats but reviews of sampled questions by mods and staff found that roughly half of tl closures probably should not have been closed meaning its correct use was affecting roughly of questions for perspective all closed questions were about 12 of those asked in its current form it seemed to be causing as much harm as good on average you 'd have to read just over 150 questions before you encountered a single one of these that 's not to say that we should ignore those questions or do care about closing them just that the total volume they represent while not trivial also ai overwhelming but the real issue is that it was working consistently what was wrong the two main problems with the old reason were no one really agreed on what it meant and it attracted false positives from trigger-words locations its description had three parts and the first two parts were very broken only relevant to a small geographic area there are extremely few questions that need to be closed due to locational constraints that are closable for other reasons and no one ever agreed on what small meant or even what units to use this was a distraction from the real need limited to a specific moment in time again there was no even semi-consistent standard some people felt that meant days others months some sites applied it to any beta which seems reasonable until you remember that gmail was in beta for five years questions that are obsolete definitely need to be addressed but most technical questions will eventually suffer that fate so making everyone pick their own definition of how short is too short before that happens was working the third part was more generalized unlikely to help any future visitors or an extraordinarily narrow situation not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet this is starting to get to the heart of why tl was important now the old wording did invite debate over when to use it the first clause seems to require just that one person other than you could benefit 2 people total while the second one suggests that some meaningful percentage of all internet users should as of today 1 of all internet users would be 24mm people but setting aside the lack of a clear line is that concept useful it is the core of it sounds like the generalized too narrow which some have suggested should be a network-wide reason like too broad but too broad has a line we 're comfortable with answerable in several paragraphs there 's still some room for interpretation but we 're all on the same planet but while we do really like the idea of too narrow because it speaks to our belief that the best questions are those that benefit more people too narrow is very very hard to establish even a rough guideline for which is why our top users are still interpreting it wildly differently even within individual sites how do we retain all the good stuff too localized was doing something important it was being used quite helpfully to allow sites to cull the specific types of one-off questions that their experts did want the most common of these by far was code dump find my typo questions on stack overflow where the author provides a huge block of code or a broken site 's url with little more than why not working they should be closed but it 's actually a lot easier to close them as a specific off-topic reason because it eliminates all those silly debates about whether someone else might make the same typo or how many helpees are required instead we say our definition of our topic has explicitly excluded that we 're not debating anything our store simply does sell that thing we 've refined our definition of what 's on-topic here the headline may be programming but what we mean is programming but not code dumps programming but not whiteboard problems programming tools yes programming snacks no it 's really not all that different than the way other sites over time identified the specific question types they do want and made them off-topic gaming but not name that game photography but not fix this picture cooking recipe replacements yes cooking recipe requests no most of those could fall under too localized but it actually makes more sense to make them part of the definition of the topic because it makes their closure less subject to interpretation what now post any gaps as answers here we hope the above helps make some of you less worried as we do think this will actually work better for the key good uses of tl but we 're still a little worried about gaps if you find a question that previously fell under tl but for some reason ca easily be dealt with through off-topic post it as an answer here so we can follow up and adjust as needed for sites other than so you may want to discuss it on your local meta first to get community consensus but that 's up to you	what do i use for too localized now i was about to vote to close as too localized but the changes in today 's blog post just took effect what do i do now here is the question website messing up in ie this is clearly too localized is it this link wo be around forever and if i have to go to an external page for the question to make sense what good will this do anyone in the future should these types of questions still be closed or put on hold and if so as what for now i voted unclear what you 're asking since i think the op should add additional details to highlight exactly what you need some code i also left this comment please post the relevant code so this will be useful in the future is this the right approach

true	add a voted to close activity event somewhere on the user profile page often when i vote to close i want to go back and check the comments on the question to see if it 's been improved to comment further or to answer the question it would be helpful to add a bit of a trail so i can find those questions again i 'm suggesting adding an event to the activity page on the user profile because this is the logical spot for the given action i realize the activity page is public but i do see why this content could be added only for the currently logged-in user an alternative would be to add a new tab on the user profile page that only lists current-user content and is not shown publicly i 'm sure there are other events data or statistics that could be shown here as well so i 'm certain a new tab like this would be underutilized one thing that could be done instead of this is to always add a comment stating why i voted to close this works well enough but only some of the time for example if there is already a vote to close as a duplicate and a comment with a link to that duplicate i 'm not going to add a comment myself if i have nothing to add aside from a close vote another way to do it would be to favourite the question this only works well to a point since questions that get voted to close do necessarily end up being downvoted for my closed favourites i could just look at the last page of my favourites related jon skeet suggested that votes to close on your own questions be shown in the recent activity area which is not what i 'm requesting here	why is there no list of questions you 've voted to close or delete possible duplicate add a voted to close activity event somewhere on the user profile page the activity history in my profile shows pretty much everything else aside from my flag history which is only visible to me privately it shows thinks i 've edited commented on and even that i voted to suggested edits why does it not show when i vote to close questions or vote to delete for 10k users i do see any reason why it should be shown after all the list of people who voted to close is made publicly visible in the question once it gets closed anyways even if it 's only made visible to that user would it be possible to add an option under the activity tab for votes that will list votes you 've made to close questions and delete

a site that i can use in a meaningful way offering the whole site in a set of different languages i 'm thinking something along the lines of no i do have a clear cut solution but i have some ideas to add the google can handle the translation of the overall site links navigation and what-whats i am a user i google to a question i see a drop-down with a label saying this question has been translated into a number of different languages by other kind so users i click the drop-down german zulu spanish uzbek hooray i am an uzbekistani user i read the translated question and see that it is indeed what i am looking for happily the accepted answer and a few of the other highly voted answers have also been translated they each have translation drop-downs but because i selected uzbek on the op the translated answers have been shown and highlighted swish  this answer solves my problem exactly thanks so community and look at that the advertising on the page is also now translated into uzbek that banner looks interesting click i am a fluent speaker it is a slow day at work and i 've only earned 37 so points this week shocking hmmm here is a question with 3726483 views and it has been translated yet score so offers me humungerous amounts of so points for quality translations that get accepted by at least three other translation who also get points my translation is only available once it has been accepted i 'm going to do a jolly good job of this translation because if i do future uzbek users will downvote my translation not what i translated as being well poo and then i and the mods will lose lots and lots of points for every downvote and do nobody want that i am an uzbekistani genius i have the answer to this question because i can read english well enough but writing it is a whole other story i know the answer and it is earth shattering and remarkable i write the answer in uzbek because i am able to fluently articulate my brilliant thoughts in my mother tongue i check a box saying requires translation select the language because if i do my untranslated answer will get savagely and click post i know that my answer is now awaiting translation into english

true	how many on or off topic votes does a question need to count against questions needed now i was just looking at this question on area51 it has eleven great on topic votes and no other votes the site still says they need ten questions of all sorts what 's the new goal i 'm worried about how much consensus you expect in a site before it can go to commit even at just ten votes you would still need twenty people who agreed exactly about the set of on and off topic questions to get a site into the commit phase math original 10 votes 10 questions 10 votes for question assumed 5 votes per follower 100 votes 5 votes 20 users current math with above actual 30 vote limit 10 questions 30 votes for question current actual 5 votes per follower 300 votes 5 votes 60 users this inclines me to wonder if the limit is actually 30 which would require 60 users to be in agreement	how does an area 51 proposal go from definition to commitment possible duplicate how many on or off topic votes does a question need to count against questions needed now i currently have 60 followers on my proposal and it says i need 5 on-topic and 5 off-topic questions i have 31 submitted questions 9 have more than 5 on-topic votes and 5 have more than 5 off-topic votes how many votes do i need to have for a single question to be on-topic and off-topic also is there a way this information could get added to the area 51 faq it seems like it should be in there along with all of the guidelines for moving between stages
true	do throw away all votes when a user is deleted currently when a moderator deletes a user all of the user 's votes are removed along with the user himself i was pretty surprised at this behaviour when i first heard about it and i do think it is a good idea to throw away all of the votes just because the user is deleted votes are locked after a short while and you ca change your vote unless the post is edited this is a precedent that shows that users do have complete control over their old votes their ability to change or remove their votes is restricted for the benefit of the whole site i do understand why users that get deleted are suddenly exempt from this restriction the drawback of removing the votes is that we throw away valuable information voting plays an important role on se sites and every time an active user is deleted we throw away some of that information i also do see why rage-quitting users get to remove one kind of contribution votes while we stop them if they try to remove their other contributions to the site posts we stop users from deleting all their posts because they still provide value to the site i do see why we shoud treat votes any different they might have less value than posts but they are useful to the site as a whole i 'm ignoring any vote invalidation in connection with vote fraud or sock puppeting for the purposes of this post those votes should certainly be invalidated but that does usually happen by deleting users to prevent abuse of user deletion for vote fraud there could be some minimum requirements on account age and reputation below those requirements any votes would be discarded on deletion any suspicious voting patterns of the user should automatically block the deletion until they have been checked manually this is of course more effort for the moderators but account self-deletion does happen so often that this would be a problem in my opinion the recent change to counting reputation from deleted questions if they are old enough and have at least three upvotes moves the whole reputation system further into a direction where reputation ca be taken away after some time the reasoning for this change was that even though certain questions are off-topic now they used to be on-topic and therefore the reputation earned had some meaning then this provides further precedent that reputation should be removed retroactively on a large scale	user was removed means i lose my hard-earned points i have been using stack overflow for 2 years and 9 months i really like the way this site works but i am totally amused by how someone else 's wrong deeds cost me my hard-earned reputation points i many times check my reputation loss and find the message user was removed come on why am i losing points for someone 's wrongdoings i just answered to help someone i do know personally whether has the right intentions i have lost roughly 40-45 reputation points because of this i have referred to all posts regarding this on meta but did understand why this was required is it time for policy change on stack exchange

true	should wiki review rejects of plagarism have a source i submitted a backticks wiki entry and one reviewer said the material was plagiarized i do mind saying my contributions are minor however this is a particularly nasty form of rejection i have written this text from scratch it is possible that my memory sub-consciously found something i read in the past perhaps this was an incident of clicking on the wrong reason radio button or maybe the intent was references are needed i actually search around the web for references but i did find anything would some additional text showing the source of plagiary be very helpful the only source i may have quoted was jonathan leffler were they noted a difference between backtick and to allow nesting however i thought the text was significantly different and it originated on stack overflow plagiarism is not a crime per se but in academia and industry it is a serious moral offence and cases of plagiarism can constitute copyright infringement wikipedia certainly when ever i am writing a tag wiki i look at all the question tagged on stack overflow is this considered an infringement i thought we were sort of a collective and the tag wiki should have to attribute the question the tag is describing some sort of additional text on what the plagiary was would be most helpful edit for reference here is the reject reason list as of dec 2013 the copied content is the first reason in the list which causes the plagiary reason text this is unknown to some lower reputation users of stack overflow	should accusations of plagiarism be allowed as baseless and easy way to put veto this wiki was totally empty neither the excerpt nor the body had a letter so i devised both and was accused of plagiarism just because there obviously is no prior art that i supposedly just copypasted as i typed it from my head i am not speaking of the overall quality of the edit and whether it is worse than nothing that is for another question this one is strictly about plagiarism that is bad because that is an insult it is not good when people may insult others just because they felt like it person being accused should have a way to ask accuser to at least substantiate his claim or revoke it plagiarism here works as a cheap way to put veto without thinking of reasons and at the same time prohibiting other reviewers from doing more thoughtful evaluation if the baseless insult is a community-approved way then that would discourage any attempt to compose an genuine text or make edits at all it just feels as being suddenly raided by trolls that can not be argued with and there really is no way at stack exchange to argue so next time why risk it i think that piracy and plagiarism are rather strong insults and must not go without the substantiation just because it was a lazy way to press buttons if a person wants to reject some contribution for reasons like plagiarism or license violation i think it should be mandatory that stack exchange site requests him to back his claim and explicitly name what the source was it is not matter of taste or habit it is a public accusation of crime or dishonesty on their part just because it felt easy lazy way to press no is not enough to commit insults if a person is sure about his claim that that act had taken place it would be easy to him to show the original source original license and key in few words if he does not bother to spend few seconds in google then he does not has standing to make accusations like ps there is an answer suggesting that the reason of rejections just does not matter and it is normal when it is selected at random if so then there should not be insulting reasons accusations of should be just removed from the list of canned responses then if it is okay to throw a dice when rejecting

true	build and strengthen the stack exchange community with crossover questions between sites i 've been a stack exchange contributor for a couple of years now currently most active on one thing that keeps coming up is questions that would appeal to audiences on two different stack exchange sites but there are almost no features taking advantage of these questions on we have crossover questions most often with and possibly next most often with but it can happen with almost any se site today alone we had a question that would cross over with and had a question that would cross over with us i am absolutely sure that this must happen all the time between arbitrary pairs of stack exchange sites but the only feature that takes advantage of it is the possibility of migrating off-topic questions which leaves the original question acting as a redirect across the two sites i think there is a missed opportunity to build the network between sites where users of one site do realize they could make valuable contributions to a sister site they have had so far little to do with at the very least there could be a way to advertise a question on a second site that could be interested in it probably by listing it in the sidebar where there are also links to meta questions linked questions related questions new blog posts and but there could also be some kind of features that make some sort of acceptable crossposting there could be added around building cross-site questions or whatever else you can think up i think this is a great way for people to spread their expertise from their main site onto other sites to make the network stronger and more cohesive to bring more attention to questions that would have a divided audience between two sites i can think only of positives and no negatives does anyone else have some ideas to add or think this is a bad idea for any reason example crossover questions here are some links to some crossover questions i 've been finding in the stack exchange network here this was previously posted as an answer but more people wanted it to be part of the question stream airfare data is it possible to cook pasta at room temperature with low enough pressure is our mental lexicon structured like a tag-cloud system or hierarchical in latent semantic analysis how do you recombine the decomposed matrices after truncating the singular values if travelling through excessively cold regions what steps should you take to keep your vehicle warm enough to drive what is usually an american breakfast outside of the us how do bicycle spokes work where is a tripod allowed from high up in new york city twitter image encoding challenge if the letter j is only 400 500 years old was there a j sound that preceded the design of the letter british sunni muslim visiting iran with family why does stack exchange require you to click to be turned down	is there a way to link a question to more than one stack exchange site i posted the following question and answer for documentation purposes to stack overflow since that is where i originally looked for the answer and did find one installing web deploy on iis 7 with shared configuration enabled i thought it might fit on server fault as well so i was going to copy the question and answer over but was unsure if that was appropriate or if there was a better way of going about it just like copying and pasting code is not a good programming practice is there some way to reuse this on server fault

true	should we stop adding the most popular tag to the html title on every se site stack exchange started a while ago to add the most-used tag at the front of the html title to prevent scrapers from being ranked higher on google than the se site itself this makes a lot of sense for stack overflow where the most important search term is often the programming language and this search term is very often only present in form of a tag and completely omitted in the actual question title so you get titles like python how do i do x this addition improves seo a lot as the programming language is an important search term most of the time and it is often omitted in the question titles the same goes for game names on where adding the tag to the title is critical for seo but is the basic assumption behind this feature valid on other se sites as well do the question titles regularly omit important search terms that are present only in tags in my observation adding the tag in front of the title does help for many other se sites i did have a look at the most popular search terms that were used to find questions on and i did find a single one where the search term was in the tag i strongly doubt that adding the tag to the title helps the seo for questions on se sites except so and gaming and adding a tag that is an important search term does cause some harm google cuts off the title after around 70 characters a long tag in front significantly reduces the space dedicated to the actual question in search results the tag occupies the most valuable spot of the title in many cases this valuable space would be better used by the actual question title is my perception accurate that this feature might be doing more harm than good on many sites should this feature maybe be enabled on a per-site basis instead of globally here 's one example where the tag lead to the question being cuts off the tag is perfectly fine but it is not a search term people would use to find the question and the wasted space in the beginning leads to the title being cut off early	remove tags from page titles possible duplicate should we stop adding the most popular tag to the html title on every se site i do not think tags should be included in page titles currently page titles are in the form tag question title i think the tags should be omitted because it can make it difficult to tell which question is which if you have more than one question with the same tag open at once in this image i have the newest questions page on the left and four questions tagged on the right can you tell which questions are open i certainly ca all i see is and part of the first letter this is even worse with long tags tags are good for organizing questions but they do not make good page titles

true	why was my answer deleted without any appropriate reason my answer with 2 days old and over 200 up votes pretty well structured and also funny was deleted by a mod without any appropriate reason why did it take 2 days and 200 up votes to remove my answer was the fun the reason answer at the time deleted as a sock lover it 's difficult to compare socks is a red sock greater or equals than a green sock or is a sock with fingertips lower than a sock without them i offer a set of solutions the mom 's algorithm o 1 get the socks ask mom to pair them the lazy algorithm o n keep in a bucket all the socks and every time you need a sock just pick one o 1 find the other one at most o n the bucket algorithm enumerate each pair of sock with a number from 1 to n make a slot for each pair of socks with a number space o n put each sock in the corresponding slot time o 1 naive approach pick a sock time o 1 pick another sock o 1 if the two socks matches pair them put it a different basket if not keep those socks in a little fast table for further requests deal with it algorithm pick one sock pick another sock deal with it protip once you have remove your socks try to pair them with a rubber band maybe socks with velcro so when you have to wash the socks it will wash and dry in pairs after pair them remove the rubber band note if the weather is warm enough you could avoid the use of socks by wearing sandals update i 'm also curious what kind of algorithm uses sheldon cooper to pair socks last edit as a sock lover it 's difficult to compare socks is a red sock greater or equals than a green sock or is a sock with fingertips lower than a sock without them i offer a set of solutions the mom 's algorithm o 1 get the socks ask mom to pair them clarification yes this is obviously a distributed approach you can add workers in this case moms and you can get the job done faster and as a matter of fact the truth is that my mother always use this algorithm on me the lazy algorithm o n keep in a bucket all the socks and every time you need a sock just pick one o 1 find the other one at most o n clarification for all pairs of socks the time complexity is o n 2 but from the human perspective avoid all the work until is absolute necessary this approach has more appeal the bucket algorithm enumerate each pair of sock with a number from 1 to n make a slot for each pair of socks with a number space o n put each sock in the corresponding slot time o 1 clarification yeah this is a classical bucket sort the time complexity is better if the number of socks groups is relative small compared to all the pair of socks naive approach pick a sock time o 1 pick another sock o 1 if the two socks matches pair them put it a different basket if not keep those socks in a little fast table for further requests deal with it algorithm pick one sock pick another sock deal with it clarification this solution actually works and it 's the most efficient if all the socks are equal it also works if you are not very exigent protip once you have remove your socks try to pair them with a rubber band maybe socks with velcro so when you have to wash the socks it will wash and dry in pairs after pair them remove the rubber band clarification the trick here is why separate the socks in the first place yeah that is a rhetorical question if you can always maintain the pairs together note if the weather is warm enough you could avoid the use of socks by wearing sandals clarification another valid solution is to avoid using socks in the first place	removal of an answer possible duplicate why was my answer deleted without any appropriate reason so the thread that exploded last week on stack overflow about sorting socks actually had a lot of interesting ideas on it ideas that developers often do consider when they are coding i added an entry that was somewhat comical about entropy but no worse than a bunch of the other ones on the thread and some dogooder came along and deleted it seems completely arbitrary and counter productive wikimedia has ways of preventing such autocratic action what recourse is available on so

true	increase close vote weight for gold tag badge holders in order to increase the efficiency with which poor quality questions are closed it could make sense to have weighted close votes for a small subset of qualified users a very good way to measure the qualified users would be to leverage the tag badges however it needs to be rationally limited to a set of users that are knowledgeable with the subject a very good way to measure the top users in a tag would be to look at those who have a gold badge in the tag if two users who have a gold tag badge pertinent to a question issue a close vote the question should probably be closed or probably will be very soon under the current system i think it would make sense to allow users with a gold tag badge to have a 3x weight for close votes in those tags please keep in mind this is suggesting full moderator one click closure it only adds weight to the vote a single user could not do it on their own these singular users cast close votes all the time so that aspect would not change some will vote to close some wont but the ones who do should have a stronger weight to their vote even with 3x it will require 2 of said votes to accomplish or still 2 other users meaning 3 agreed it should be closed which is the same amount of high rep users it takes to delete a question and that has a much greater impact than closure tldr allow gold tag badge users to have a weighted close vote in their tag	give more weight to from tag badge carriers especially for some of the less frequented tags such as matlab it can take a long time till a question is closed as duplicate for example how to load a series of files into matlab matrix via loop has been up for closing for over a week given that gold and silver tag badges usually mean that a user has spent quite a bit of time answering questions user with these badges are also more likely to remember the duplicates which may have a non-intuitive title and thus not show up in the automated search i suggest to give the more 2-3x for gold and 2x for silver weight to gold silver tag badges for votes of a question with that tag obviously to make the duplicate questions disappear more quickly note three years later a similar suggestion was very positively received see link to duplicate

true	suspecting sock puppets what now i stumbled over the following which made me a bit puzzled a user quite low rep asked a question whose solution appeared immediately tricky but unfortunately it was quite unclear ambiguous and required clarification shortly after another user replied to that unclear question with an almost ridiculous simple answer that made me immediately think that the user who answered has apparently completely missed the underlying possibly hidden tricky problem imho his overly simplistic answer not only requires invalid assumptions about the problem but it was in no way a suitable approach to solve it nonetheless the almost funny answer was accepted quickly and to my astonishment was up voted seven times in a just a minute puzzled that made me curious and thus i queried other answers of the user who answered the question and not to my surprise they all came out a bit suspect after a closer look and some further queries i suspected the user is using sock puppets and some other fraudulent activities to gain votes i gathered the following the main account 's answer will be accepted quickly even when the question is still very unclear and ambiguous and requires clarification the main account 's other answers accepted or not receive up votes which happen in batches in a very short duration which indicates there are a number of sock puppets contributing to the up votes which are all controlled by one person this happens now and then the main account 's answer is often not quite correct oftentimes there are a few comments from third who question the main account 's accepted answer or even conclude that it is outright wrong the main account 's answer not accepted gets up voted at a certain time even though there is a far better accepted answer from a third which does get up voted at the same time this is weird at least the suspected puppet as a questioner is somewhat unimpressed by the other more correct answers and also by valid comments the puppet 's and the main account 's english is somewhat broken and easy to identify a puppet and the main account built a group who interact to each other with votes and accepts the main account often answers its own question with a bunch of up votes it seems there have been answers deleted from the main 's account formerly already i 'm a bit reluctant to disclose the user what should i do in this case	how to report a potential rep-farming sock-puppet i 've just found a pair of users one who only asks questions one who only answers both are low rep new users and almost all the askers questions have accepted answers by the answerer the answers are that good either asker answerer

false	add sponsored links to sidebar i would like to request additional advertising i know right the idea for this feature request first came about as part of my recent attempts to get a guy who may or may not be spamming to purchase advertising on stack overflow in the form of a sponsored tag one problem i 've run into and it might just be in my own head is the value of the sponsored tag it appears that a sponsored tag involves two basic forms of value a logo on the tag itself and sponsored links for the tag that appear on the questions of a particular tag pages i suggest that additional value could be had from a sponsored tag if the sponsored links also appear on questions that are tagged with the sponsored tag i suggest putting it in the side bar thus unfortunately the page i chose did have a side-bar ad but i 'd suggest putting the sponsored links section below the sidebar ad for the page i chose the page i did because it had two sponsored tags and that leads to a functionality discussion for such a case i 'd suggest displaying only a few sponsored links with a user-selectable expansion to display all sponsored links in the case of more than one sponsored tag appearing in the section chose one sponsored link randomly from each sponsored tag and display all of them in the user-selected expansion i feel this would be a large-benefit change adding value to sponsored tag options while remaining benign to the end user it takes up little real-estate and increases the chances of the links being displayed which could translate directly into revenue for the advertiser and sofu in general i 've already searched for suggestions similar to this and came up empty apologies if i missed i swear i did the research	where can i get feedback on a website design i want to get feedback from professional designers

true	grant the op a binding close as duplicate vote since the changes to the close as duplicate mechanism it is a lot more visible to the op that there be a duplicate to their question empirically i 've noticed a lot more people agreeing in the comments under their question that their question is a dupe for instance here i 'm aware that allowing a binding close vote is status-declined back in the stone age but now stack exchange is so much larger and stack overflow is groaning under the weight of questions i think this should be partially revisited based on the principle that the simplest way to keep a site clean is to have as many people as possible nibbling away i propose that the op gets granted a binding vote it should simply be an additional line in the banner which is shown only to the question asker it might be something like this this question may already have an answer here allow question askers to close their own questions unilaterally 3 answers does this fully answer your question yes no i 'm not wedded to the yes no thing i just ca think of a better way at the moment clicking on yes would take the op to the close as duplicate dialogue with that question highlighted if there are multiple duplicate questions you 'd need to ask the op multiple times a no could be used to track the relative success of the project whether the question subsequently gets closed whether the question gets reopened again how many times the op actually clicks how many times the op disagrees with the analysis of the community potentially a no could be used to open a comment dialogue asking the op to explain why they think their question is not a duplicate thereby stopping them simply putting this is not a duplicate in the question and formalising this process somewhat not sure about this idea i do not think this should be restricted by reputation anyone should be able to close their own question as a duplicate it gives people with lower reputation a more positive experience of the closing process and emphasises the importance of duplicate finding most importantly self-closes should not initially count towards the question ban we can help new users learn how to use a lot more of the site than they might otherwise see and encourage them to search for duplicates more thoroughly if the op then goes on to do the same thing 10 times in a row then you can start using it toward the ban as they 're obviously using the users as a personalised search service but at least the first 3-4 times this should not have any effect this question is deliberately only requesting 20 of the linked question from 2009 and then only based on the new ui the linked question asks for binding migration votes etc which i do not want to see and i am not requesting a binding for the op until someone else has already voted to close though i think if the op has 3k rep this might be allowable this i hope addresses the concern 's raised in the linked question and explains why this is not a duplicate of that question	now that duplicate means has an answer somewhere else op should be able to close own question as duplicate unilaterally as of before i made the title twice as long but more specific you should read my function names my question is a duplicate of closing my own question as a duplicate oct 2010 allow question askers to close their own questions unilaterally july 2009 however our business logic has changed so much since then and since i find the logic in the original questions obsolete i 'm re-raising this as i have argued all over the place and there is some consensus on duplicates are much more like valid questions that happen to be answered somewhere else than they are like close-candidate questions i 'm putting this in bold since it is okay to re-open feature requests if there is a reason things have changed and also here and our current most official stance on duplicates being warmly received comes from november 2010 more recent than either of the questions above the reasoning the op can accept an answer unilaterally should the op be able to unilaterally accept an answer on a linked question close as duplicate if the question turns out to be a duplicate the op has no way to indicate the question is resolved until at least 5 users have participated those 5 users should not have had to drill into the question to figure this out much like accepting an answer in general all the reasons accepting answers is important apply perfectly well here

false	should i mark as duplicate if the question is answered elsewhere but it 's not the same question i 'm looking for policy or guidance on the following situation someone just posted a new question q1 i noticed that one of the existing answers to another question q2 already answers q1 the answer to q2 happens to be general enough that it answers not just q2 but also q1 however q1 is not the same question as q2 they are somewhat related but they 're definitely different questions in particular not every good answer to q2 would answer q1 what should i do in this situation should i mark q1 as a duplicate of q2 should i avoid marking it as a duplicate is it a judgement call is there any general policy or guideline where i looked for information on this the closest related question i could find on mso was at what point does a question become a duplicate  there shog writes if a new question is answered by the answers to an old question i will generally consider it a duplicate the exception to this is when an answer to the new one does or potentially could add a significant amount of useful information so that makes me think it is often ok to mark q1 as a duplicate of q2 but not always the official guidance says to close a question as a duplicate when it is sufficiently similar to existing questions and would be answered identically to them which makes it sound pretty simple do not mark q1 as a duplicate of q2 if it 's relevant when a question is closed as a duplicate it is marked with the label this question already has an answer here i suppose this could be taken to suggest that it 's ok to mark q1 as a duplicate of q2 though personally i doubt that we should be looking to that wording for guidance or policy about duplicates i 've read close reason proposal answer exists elsewhere but that sounds like a different situation to me so i 'm not sure whether the discussion there is applicable for those who read grace note 's answer there for instance the mkdir example is not quite the same situation because those were two unrelated questions and the hypothesized answer is not likely to be a good answer to both questions i 've also read should we answer questions if the answers can be found elsewhere on the site but i 'm not 100 clear on how that applies to the situation i gave above if you want to see the specific situation where i ran into this most recently it is this question decide whether a dfa accepts the empty language but i most interested in the general for what to do in this situation as i see this sort of situation from time to time	how do i post tips on stack exchange i understand stack exchange follows the format but how do i share great ideas that i stumble upon and think it maybe useful to others as well

false	badge proposal problem solver possible duplicate badges for accepted answers more than x as a relatively new se acolyte it seems odd to me that there is no badge directly tied to the amount of accepted answers it seems logical that the goal of answering a question should be to provide one that the asker finds satisfactory se seems to already support that ideology by awarding more reputation for an accepted answer than a upvote so i 'm surprised that there are basically no badges directly tied to this it seems strange to me that a user could potentially piggy back on high volume questions providing supplementary answers and get a lot of votes but not contribute to satisfying the site 's question base not to say that supplementary questions are bad i 'm just saying that i think it makes sense to provide incentive to not only display knowledge and popular opinion but also to reward good listeners and problem solvers that are aiding in the site 's overall purpose	multiple search queries at once when searching through the primary search bar the query is made off of the entire string searching hello world takes the string at face value is there a way of splitting the query to search for two things at once searching hello world takes two strings into query hello world  if something like this is added it would be an excellent feature

true	invite low rep users to participate in chat i 'm aware of the preference for general answers to general questions attitude on so and wholeheartedly agree that questions that are focused on specific one-time issues are not as valuable to the site however where an issue is potentially useful but getting to the heart of it is taking some doing the obvious option is to migrate the discussion to chat once the user has a better understanding of their issue the question can be edited to a useful form and answered succinctly for future readers the issue as noted in other questions here is that these situations most often occur with a sub 20 rep user and so with the chat feature denied a long discussion in the comments becomes likely i totally understand the sentiments expressed here add invite user to chat function on main site and i do feel that a chat session should be used to completely solve a users problem but it would be nice if the chat could be made available while a user 's issue is being made clear and so the actual proposal would it be possible to enable the invite to chat feature for sub 20 rep users based on an invite from a higher rep user who can be trusted to use the chat conversation in the correct manner and take the results back to the originating question the sub 20 rep user could be locked to that single chat instance and still unable to participate in the main boards the inviting user should have a much higher rep somewhere in the thousands and so would hopefully use the feature responsibly in a way that was aimed at providing a worthwhile question and answer as the result	can we allow users with 1k reputation or something to grant users without the reputation access to a specific chat room there have been several times i have been helping a user with a question and things are quite working out perfectly and the comments keep getting longer and longer and longer we 've all been there the comment system is made for long discussions and at some point we just want to throw up our hands and give up i 've tried creating a chat room to discuss the issue in a better environment but if they have less than 20 reputation that is possible if you are room owner of that chat room like you probably are if you created it and have 1k rep you can make a room read-only but you ca give a user explicit write access to a room even though you have access to the controls tl dr can we please allow users with 1k or some amount of reputation the ability to give write access to users with less than 20 reputation in chat currently only moderators can do this this question allow temporary guest accounts in chat is related but is really the same request
false	when should we undo downvote i downvote very rarely sometimes the answer has been edited after to a good answer and i will like to undo it but sometimes although the answer is corrected now i may feel it 's not right to just undo the downvote so my question is is there a general guideline of which extent should we undo the downvote some examples i feel not 100 comfortable to undo	should moderators be making questions community wiki i do think moderators should be arbitrarily marking questions as community wiki thus denying users of potential reputation points for example i was just searching su and found this question why did diago mark it as cw i thought the same thing about this so question mark gravell marked it as cw for some reason why because it got too much attention so what let the community determine what is community wiki one of several things will take care of questionable questions it will be so freakishly popular that the number of answers will switch it soon enough the community will pressure the person who asked the question into making it cw or the community will be put off and ignore it of course they may just as well accept it as just a really popular question

true	what to do with cross-site duplicates what 's the right course of action for cross-site duplicates there are two flavors a question is posted which belongs on another site and ends up already having been asked there i ca find an example right now but it 's bound to happen soon if it has already the same question is posted in two places at the same time take this so question for example which is a duplicate of this sf question posted within a half hour of each other by the same user possible actions move it to the proper site and close it once it gets there as a duplicate provide a way to close it right away as a cross-site duplicate without moving it first flag it and let a moderator merge them close it as no longer relevant or something else additionally flavor 2 is a bit of a special case perhaps the question really spans both sites in terms of content and intended audience should multiple-postings in this case be allowed if so should they somehow be linked to each other if not how do we avoid a migration war	what 's the accepted procedure for questions that have been answered on another stack exchange site vim74 e149 sorry no help for on stack overflow seems to me to be asking much the same question as vim errors e433 no tags file e149 no help for on super user that second question has what i think is a good answer but of course that 's not on stack overflow and i 'm not sure that such a question does belong on stack overflow nor even that it instead does belong on super user i do necessarily like the idea of an answer simply saying see the answer to this question on super user and indeed although i did attempt to post such an answer it was deemed trivial and converted to a comment but in the case of a user coming across this question say by means of searching i 'd like there to at least be a link to the answer on super user so that the question is a dead end what 's generally supposed to be done in this sort of case

false	should stack exchange make room for conjecture knowledge based answers should stack exchange make room for conjecture or based ideas my question is a philosophical one if we are to assume that the full breadth and capacity of human knowledge has been reached and can be referenced by sources then by all means we should demand that every claim response or idea should be cited however if we admit that there are very creative and valuable thoughts and ideas that have not been conceived then we should have a system within stack exchange to allow for this sort of discourse for instance there may be a contributor out there who has vast knowledge in a particular field their ideas may be so bleeding edge that they are widely considered highly unconventional controversial there may not be any research to back up their claims if he were to make a post that someone did agree with his answers would get voted down he may lose reputation and he may eventually become frustrated and decide to leave the site and not contribute further to the community i think this is an unfortunate situation and one to be avoided creative and unconventional thought forms the very basis of scientific and analytical understanding i do think stack exchange should discourage thinking and conjecture another more practical example would simply be the case of your typical professional who comes across a stack exchange site and would like to contribute it 's very simple for someone with lots of experience in a particular field to answer many questions from a very abstract or big-picture point of view in relative short order but to ask this same person to back up every claim and every admonition with references may cause the professional to choose not to devote his time to contributing again i think this is an unsatisfactory outcome all that being said i do not think opinion conjecture experience and knowledge based answers should go unchecked but i also do think these contributions should automatically be seen as unhelpful to the community perhaps stack exchange would benefit from implementing a system of flagging an answer or portions of an answer as conjecture or knowledge-based or what have you and perhaps this could grab the attention of the community somehow and promote a discussion where further explanation could be asked of the poster personally i think ideas which challenge the status quo should get more promotion than those that do maybe they could be highlighted as novel or unique and contributors could vote separately on this response to decide it 's relevance to the question and perhaps its ultimate position in rank i think the worst thing is to allow voting down and simply ignoring responses of this nature it 's unproductive and stifles creativity in this community	indicating interesting tags in the recent tags list would it make sense to somehow highlight the user 's interesting tags in the list of recent tags on the homepage use case hmm there have been some active questions lately let 's have a look at them without the highlight the interesting tags are likely to drown in the noise

true	can a new programmer with limited technical expertise ask a quality question about fundamentals on so subtitle should beginner 's questions be off-topic strictly because they are beginner 's questions the sorts of questions that newbie programmers ask has come up before many times in side discussions and comes up constantly on the main site here are two examples from today usage of in function calls confused vertical bar both of the above questions are well-formed specific answerable definitively not open to opinions and are otherwise directly on-topic for stackoverflow however both questions were downvoted and closed by users who said they were off-topic because they were too basic in nature to quote one particularly pointed comment this question appears to be off-topic because it is trivially answerable by reading a beginners language tutorial that pretty much sums it up here 's another case posted yesterday just starting oop in am i using the this operator correctly this is another beginner 's question the topic is fairly elementary the answer can likely be found in strustrup 's book or any number of other books that we recommend considering only that it is a beginner 's question of a fundamental nature should the question be considered off-topic lots of questions are posted from lazy people who are just looking to be spoon-fed answers those questions should all be closed because they never meet the quality guidelines that 's not what i 'm asking about here what i 'm asking about is just the elementray nature of the question if the question is elementary but otherwise meets our quality and topical requirements is it off-topic i have always thought that stack overflow is for professional and enthusiast programmers people who write code because they love it but enthusiasts come in all shapes and sizes from the bright-green newbie writing their first program to the grizzled veterans who have seen and done it all a million times before i have always felt that so 's stated audience does not or should not discriminate based on the expertise of the asker some would say that newbie questions are off-topic because they are interesting enough for the answerers but this seems highly subjective to me after all every question is a no-duh softball to someone just today i provided what i thought was a pretty novel solution to a problem only to learn a few minutes later that konradrudolph and yakk had come up with the same solution over a year before no-duh it seems to me that this has been coming up much more recently sometimes i 'll chime in with a comment to the downvoters and close-voters suggesting that the level of expertise is not a parameter in deciding if a question is topical the downvoters will often agree but we do have a difinitive resource to point to that says this is so it does say it in the faqs and i 've not found anything difinitive in meta so what says meta can a question about basics be on-topic for stack overflow if it can be off-topic how do we know where to draw the line	what is syntax highlighting and how does it work i noticed that sometimes my code gets highlighted in different colors when rendered what is syntax highlighting how does it work what if my code is highlighted correctly how do i report a bug or request a new language what languages are currently available on stack exchange return to faq index how can i prevent syntax higlighting in markdown when i wished to show example data i used the code block syntax 4 spaces indentation after an empty line but the data was rendered like a programming language can i prevent the syntax highlighting 1236 1237 or is there another syntax in markdown edit i the above example the problem seems not to occur the original problem and data james bond 200010 was here bank project how do i read string from file convert to float and sum all

true	why is there a way to consolidate answers there should be a way to consolidate answers into one or at least choose a set of answers as the accepted answer as a question can sometimes have multiple answers for instance if a question is asked for a list of software that can be used for the build process and many users suggest different software there should be a way to consolidate these answers into one group this prevents users from having to edit the question and consolidate the answers back into the question or create their own answer with an amalgamation of the answers this would allow votes on answers to be credited back to the original answerer rather than to the person who created the consolidated answer it would also prevent the person from having to group the answers together ui considerations do apply here as to what the best way is to group these answers together as one can imagine that some of the answers in the group could possibly be fairly long maybe a consolidation can come along with an edit to summarize the responses but still list and credit the answerers edit on further consideration of this it may be best to let the consolidated answer automatically become community wiki but let it automatically the answers you have chosen to consolidate so that users can vote on those answers individually if they like it also prevents votes on the consolidated answer from going to any particular individual edit an add-on to the above suggestion of making it community-wiki is to perhaps make it a special type of answer that combines the votes from all of the chosen combined individual answers but does not have its own vote count per se the votes seen on that question would merely be the combined amount this allows votes to go to the respective answerers and still allows the person to choose an accepted answer	how to mark multiple right answers possible duplicate why is there a way to consolidate answers suppose a question receives more than one answer out of which i find that two that each address exactly 50 of the question in my view both should be marked answers to the question is there a way to mark them thus

false	accept rate misleading please correct i do meant to be critical you guys are programmers not english grammaticians but this is obviously wrong and needs to be fixed fortunately the solution is relatively simple please make this improvement with as much haste as reasonable	transform the town hall chat into an asynchronous for candidates there are two methods users can ask questions to the candidates in a moderator elections they can comment on the nomination they can ask a question in the town hall chat the comment system has the disadvantages that it is nearly invisible once the nomination phase is over that it is unorganized and often filled with tangential comments and that candidates can easily avoid it by nominating shortly before the deadline the town hall chat is a very good idea in principle but i do think that using chat for this is ideal the huge main problem is that using chat severely limits the number of users that can actively participate you have to be present at the exact time which is often difficult especially when different timezones come into play of course users can ask someone else to put forth a specific question and read the transcript later but that is not obvious to most users the timing is also less than ideal as the exact time and date can only be arranged after the nomination is finished which puts the town hall rather late into the election cycle instead of a real-time chat i would propose that users can submit questions during the nomination phase and that all candidates then get the opportunity to answer those questions whenever they have time this would eliminate the need to find a date and time for the chat event which is usually rather difficult due to timezone differences it might also make sense to allow voting on the questions themselves and give an easy way to see the answers of the candidates to the most upvoted questions it might also be necessary to be able to close non-constructive questions the idea is to give voters more chances to ask the candidates questions and to make the results more easily available and more obvious than the current town hall transcripts
false	votes rep threshold too low this perfectly good question was flagged as a possible duplicate of this one imho it very clearly is the op identified a particular usage pattern and asked about it yet it has already gained four close votes and so is perilously close to getting closed even though the question itself has 17 upvotes and my accepted answer has 23 and counting this suggests to me that those voting to close it are not applying due diligence given just how many 3k rep users there now are 5500 should perhaps that threshold be raised edit ok it did get closed and re-opened again i wonder whether the exposure of the question here on meta contributed to the rapid reopening i expect it did since the votes on the question also jumped after i posted this question and no i was rep whoring as i hit the rep cap today already however since the closure revealed who had voted and therefore their reps we can see that they were 33k 10k 8k 7k and 5k of the 8k user was the one that posted the original imho incorrect close vote but there 's no way to revoke a close vote i do know whether those numbers support my original assertion that the rep threshold may be too low i 'm inclined to think they do	can we disable the steward badge for low traffic beta sites i am witnessing very bad voting behaviour on a low traffic beta site which i suspect is the work of one fanatic user who is gunning for easy gold badges such as the steward badge and the electorate badge low quality one-liner answers and badly asked questions are being up-voted on a regular basis this has affected the overall quality of the site as bad questions and answers are being encouraged the problem is compounded by the fact that high-rep users are not down-voting enough on the site i noted that someone had already asked a similar question before but what i am requesting is for this to apply only to low traffic beta sites where there is only a handful of questions a day all these can be reviewed at the landing page itself without even the need to go to the review queue the badge is only useful for high traffic sites where new posts aged very quickly it is not particularly useful for posts that stay on the front page for quite some time and is counter-productive if people abused it just to get gold badges so why not have it removed on low traffic beta sites well for the uninitiated here 's the requirement for steward badge completed at least review tasks this badge is awarded once per review type in response to the queries in the comments below here are a few observations why i suspect it is the work of one user the user has an abnormally high vote count per week the user would be logged on whenever a low-quality question or answer gets up-voted the user is very active on the review queue despite the low traffic the user is still manages to obtain a reviewer 's badge in a very short time as mentioned i do not want to point fingers directly at someone therefore i am asking it here instead of asking on that site also as these are pure conjectures and not hard evidences i do not want to call out that user on the site

true	what should i do if a user posts sensitive information as part of a question or answer i 've noticed recently there has been at least two incidents of users posting a lot of detailed sensitive information from the guy the edited a post to replace it with his cv which i would say is an interesting way of getting your name known to the serverfault user that posted a question with working login credentials to his actual production server what should be the procedure in this case edit it out if you have enough rep flag for moderator attention with other flag explaining the contents as the revision history may need to be destroyed drop into a chat room with a community co-ordinator and ping them to alert them of the situation mention it in the parent 's site chat room to draw attention to it email with a link to the question and explain the issue all of the above	questions with proprietary or confidential information possible duplicate what should i do if a user posts sensitive information as part of a question or answer every once in a while when i am posting code to either ask or answer a question i find myself cleaning out all the references to the company i 'm working for and scanning for any other proprietary or confidential info i figure that if i 'm doing it others are doing it and that means that occasionally there are going to be pieces of code that we miss using system namespace hotornotdotcom public class login int timesbeforelockout 4 public login string username string password what 's the right thing to do in this circumstance if we come across something like this should we edit the info out has so ever gotten a takedown request has a user ever suffered as a result of posting code he or she has written as part of their work

true	adding a new link to a post messes up indexes in square brackets in code already present in the post in an answer i was adding some links to the documentation after i wrote some php code as result the code was altered take as example the following markdown with an indented code block if isset item 1 empty item map 1 item 1 node map 1 else the menu item is not for a node after i add the first link in a regular paragraph i get the following as expected if isset item 1 empty item map 1 item 1 node map 1 else the menu item is not for a node see 1 1 after i add the second link i get the following where the 1 indexes in the code block have been interpreted as links if isset item 1 empty item map 2 item 3 node map 4 else the menu item is not for a node see 5 and see 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 notice that the code is correctly indented with 4 spaces i was able to reproduce the bug in the sandbox i also tried with another browser as i noticed i was using a not supported browser firefox a1 with safari the result is the same the issues are two perfectly valid code is rewritten markdown links pointing to the same url are rewritten even in the case i did write php code but markdown markup there is any need to re-write all the links suppose i have the following markdown example link 1 same example link 1 the same link once again 1 1 if i add another link the other links should not be changed this is what instead happens example link 1 same example link 2 the same link once again 3 another link 4 1 2 3 4 see the sandbox example	the editor 's link functionality illegaly changes content inside code blocks possible duplicate adding a new link to a post messes up the code already present in the post when adding changing links in a post via the editor 's hyperlink button the editor may renumber link references if you insert a link at the top it will have reference 1 and other existing links will have their numbers increased the problem is this the editor will do its renumbering magic even if the combination is inside a codeblock so if i have this this code does not work myarr 3 1 7 plz help people of stackoverflow 1 1 and then use ctrl-l to insert a link at the top the editor will not only add the link and mysteriously duplicate the reference entry at the bottom but also change the unrelated code this code from the internet 1 does not work myarr 3 2 7 plz help people of stackoverflow 3 1 2 3 this post on is an example of where a user seems to have fought with this problem see the revision history
true	suspecting sock puppets what now i stumbled over the following which made me a bit puzzled a user quite low rep asked a question whose solution appeared immediately tricky but unfortunately it was quite unclear ambiguous and required clarification shortly after another user replied to that unclear question with an almost ridiculous simple answer that made me immediately think that the user who answered has apparently completely missed the underlying possibly hidden tricky problem imho his overly simplistic answer not only requires invalid assumptions about the problem but it was in no way a suitable approach to solve it nonetheless the almost funny answer was accepted quickly and to my astonishment was up voted seven times in a just a minute puzzled that made me curious and thus i queried other answers of the user who answered the question and not to my surprise they all came out a bit suspect after a closer look and some further queries i suspected the user is using sock puppets and some other fraudulent activities to gain votes i gathered the following the main account 's answer will be accepted quickly even when the question is still very unclear and ambiguous and requires clarification the main account 's other answers accepted or not receive up votes which happen in batches in a very short duration which indicates there are a number of sock puppets contributing to the up votes which are all controlled by one person this happens now and then the main account 's answer is often not quite correct oftentimes there are a few comments from third who question the main account 's accepted answer or even conclude that it is outright wrong the main account 's answer not accepted gets up voted at a certain time even though there is a far better accepted answer from a third which does get up voted at the same time this is weird at least the suspected puppet as a questioner is somewhat unimpressed by the other more correct answers and also by valid comments the puppet 's and the main account 's english is somewhat broken and easy to identify a puppet and the main account built a group who interact to each other with votes and accepts the main account often answers its own question with a bunch of up votes it seems there have been answers deleted from the main 's account formerly already i 'm a bit reluctant to disclose the user what should i do in this case	you answer my question i answer yours recently while visiting a question i saw two users on stack overflow and found uncanny activity so i visited their profile and saw that these users might be committing vote fraud one user is asking and accepting questions from a specific user and vice versa now there is no rule against one user frequently answering another user 's question but if this happens quite frequently then i guess something might be going on i believe they are sock-puppets what can i do in such a situation
true	helpless after exhausting daily limit for reviewing suggested edits i have faced this problem earlier but today i got to face this problem twice in a span of couple of minutes  i have unfortunately finished my daily quota of reviewing suggested edits but i want to further edit a post for which an edit has already been suggested by another user having less than 2000 reputation i come across a post and it says that an edit has already been suggested which is pending for review i click on edit 1 and a pop-up of suggested edit appears however the problem is this suggested edit does thoroughly deal with the post it just fixes some capitalization and nothing else no grammar fixes no sentence restructuring to make it more clear no code formatting no dividing it into lists in short perfect candidate to be rejected the image for the suggested-edit i have uploaded did have those problems however there were those problems in the edits that i encountered earlier the problem before me is that i am helpless i ca approve reject or improve the edit since i have already gone past my daily quota of reviewing them neither can i make the edits to the post since this suggested edit is pending review i am completely helpless whats the opinion of the community in this matter should we those with more than 2000 rep be able to edit them do count it in our review progress obviously not sure what should be done with the suggested edit already proposed or let it be someone else would come and edit them and other reviewers would deal with the suggested edit appropriately or something else note this might not be much of a problem for stack overflow since the review queue is very busy here however this is a bit of a problem for smaller sites so treat it as a question posted at and not so much at dirty hack ah found a dirty hack to work around this situation however this should be used unless absolutely necessary credit goes to in this comment to edit a post enter this link in your browser so to edit this particular post one would enter i repeat the hack should be used unless necessary	unable to edit pending posts when at review limit related unable to edit posts with pending edits the difference here is for people who have reached their review limit for suggested edits in a day once a suggested edit is in queue you 're locked out from giving additional edits until someone else approves the suggested edit is it status-bydesign that we should just wait for the queue to be handled before being able to apply other edits

false	more in moderator admin dashboard when converting answers to comments after using the queue for a couple of weeks now i keep wishing it did more here 's feature request 1 scenario when clicking convert to comment on a flagged answer if there are no comments a simple confirmation alert dialog is shown which is ok but breaks basic ui design rules imho because it 's inconsistent with the flow when there are comments if there are comments on the answer instead of the alert a custom popup is shown problem 1 this unnecessary difference in dialog box style is a small ui problem that on its own is enough to warrant a change but the proposal below addresses it as well so i 'm counting it problem 2 in order to make a decision on which button to press you have know what the comments are for example often there 's a comment saying this answer should be a comment worthless for conversion purposes or i tried that but it did help worthy of conversion but to see the comments you have to open a new window by clicking the answer link an anchor rendered as the question title this in itself slows down the process consuming extra time one thing mods never have enough of problem 3 however it can get worse because the window that opens has an extra moderator action bar at the bottom and sometimes it obscures all comments here 's a real example the chances of this happening at greater than you might think because there 's an entry in the mod bar for every flag anywhere on the question not just the post you 're opening it for ie the link just opens the page at the answer anchor but the mod bar does have this level of discrimination this event further delays the process because the page must be scrolled or especially if the target answer is the last answer on the page the mod bar must be dismissed all of this consumes that most precious of moderator resources time problem 4 the decision to include comments in the conversion is an decision but not all comments are worthy of conversion this leads to a further step s of having to delete any moved comments that are unworthy of being moved proposal instead of having to open a new and instead of having two separate ui styles depending on flow bring the comments into the custom popup also display a check box next to each comment plus the usual select all and deselect all buttons so any comments to be included in the conversion process can be easily and correctly selected this is how i think the popup dialog box should look the key functional requirements are displays all comments to the answer ideally with ability to edit in-place too can select which comments go with the conversion same popup component if there are no comments but with empty comments section and suitably changed message maybe no comments were posted to the answer a single action button with the straightforward name convert the mock up is just one way to achieve this it would likely be implemented using ajax on popup render since this action is not that common and it would keep the down for the flag queue page load	please show that i 've voted for a tag synonym in my suggested view since it 's so onerous to go vote on a tag-synonym violating the rule of could we please have the suggested view show that i 've already voted on a tag so that i do have to click into it then click on the to see if i have or not then you have to go back to the page and click on the next one and so on

true	another take on canonical answers add a canonical vote when closing a question as a duplicate it is becoming harder and harder to search for a good original as the pool of questions and answers grows and grows while the new dupe closing dialog is a huge step forward it does always work if you 've spent some time on the site you know there are perfect answers to many new questions but you ca always find them or ca be bothered to as your time is limited a way to further improve this could be introducing a vote for canonical answers it could for example work like this answers get a new icon the canonical vote signified here by a cannon because i ca think of anything that makes sense right now only users with a certain minimum rep maybe 1k or 2k see this icon the icon would work like the favourite icon you can toggle it on or off at any time the hover message for the icon could read this is a canonical answer it answers the question asked in the most extensive and general way and is very likely to benefit other users with the same problem questions that contain an answer with three or more canonical votes get special treatment they show up on the top in search results maybe even under a special heading questions with canonical answers they show up prominently in the close as dupe dialog the canonical votes influence the metric that is used to determine the questions shown there there could be some rewards for users whose answers receive canonical votes maybe a badge if ten of your answers get at least three canonical votes or a counter of canonical answers in your profile it would be really interesting as it 's a badge that you ca game your way to but this whole rewarding part is entirely optional kobi 's suggestions would be a great safeguard against over-use of this feature dupe but sans cannon would it be useful to be able to vote for canonical answers related what is a good way to look for a canonical answer to a frequently asked question	encyclopedia stack exchange and the canonical answer possible duplicate another take on canonical answers add a canonical vote i just read joel 's post about encyclopedia stack exchange and i 've always been a strong advocate of all four circles of the diagram but oft-times wondered where these blog type questions and answers are on our site but it 's good that joel is re-enforcing and reminding us that useful self-answered questions to share what you already know firmly belong on our sites pekka added a comment in response to this statement in the article for a long time we 've been pleading for people to write more canonical answers so the same questions do keep coming up again and again and we even have the self-learner badge which you can only earn by answering your own question pekka 's response this does take the system closer to more canonical questions and answers though the ui improvements to the vote to close dialog were a big step forward but there still is enough incentive to seriously identify dupes and look for good canonical questions i very much agree with this sentiment good canonical questions are hard to identify now and again during my mod duties and when closing questions as duplicates i find myself popping into one of the language specific chat rooms to ask the regulars who hang out there if they know of a question and answer that they would treat as a canonical post for the flagged post in hand the hardcore users of our community appear to know many of these canonical posts but this useful data is silo 'd away in the brains of these people and no-where else there 's no way to formally identify them as such other than to ask there are some reference questions dotted about but such as the big php operator question but they 're informally accepted as canonical by way of reference in the title and there 's no other way to quickly find it by tag filtering which would be the obvious way php canonical-question i 'm wondering if it would be useful to properly and officially identify canonical questions and have them tagged with a special canonical tag with the following caveat no single user would be permitted to arbitrarily add this tag to a post it would be a system tag and for a post to get this tag or canonical status it would say need to be voted on much like we do with tag synonyms returning to pekka 's mention about the close dialogue to make identification of a canonical question easier the close dialogue would try to identify matching questions as it does already but those that are tagged canonical are promoted to the top of the list and highlighted in some way bold text whatever to indicate that this is possibly the best close candidate thoughts updated boltclock just pointed out pekka 's question another take on canonical answers add a canonical vote that pretty much covers all the same ground here so feel free to close this as a dupe

false	add a magic link for revisions i just wrote this comment and thought to myself we got a link to the edit why not for revisions too i just edited your sentence from a codeblock as used on so to a blockquote this should improve readability if you do like it you can always apply a rollback in revision history thus i propose to add a magic link to the revision history of the post which is commented on in the form of revisions sorry for the link to german i just do really edit posts here	the flag weight system could use some improvements problems i see how disputed flags work as i argued here disputed flags are useless and might do more harm than good really what is the incentive to flag a flag invalid the way i see it i 'm spending one of my own flags to ensure the user who flagged incorrectly does lose any flag weight as they should while i do earn any fw the penalty for incorrect flags is way too high as your flag weight improves i 'm capped at 750 right now if i get one invalid flag it will take 92 of them for me to get back to where i was this strongly discourages folks with high fw to flag questionable content at least that 's what i think granted since your flags have more weight you should be more responsible while flagging but the risk-reward ratio is way too high imo in fact if you have maxed out fw there is no reward at all users with close privileges ie 3k ca flag questions as does belong here since that makes them cast a close vote instead if we encourage users without close privileges to flag questions that do belong why do we encourage users who cast correct close votes as well flags found in 10k only are an easy way to farm flag weight what i mean is it takes much less effort to go through flagged posts and re-flag them than to use review or flag posts in the wild about 90 of the flagged posts have correct flags while less than 5 of posts found in review are flag worthy these numbers are guesstimates based on my own experience not hard facts lack of a neutral resolution with the possibility to add a custom message that does impact the flagger 's flag weight this would be helpful in guiding flaggers without punishing them currently moderators ca provide custom feedback unless they decline a flag flag dismissal decisions eg helpful or declined ca be reversed if a mistake was made we ca fix it this results in a ton of flag weight grievance posts on meta

true	which computer science programming stack exchange do i post in there seems to be more than a few computer stack exchange networks is that the correct term  stack overflow being the first has by far the most users questions and answers what is the reasoning for creating the others and are there clear guidelines for which kinds of questions should be posted i can see a large amount of potential overflow many cases of people not getting a good answer to their question because the person who has the answer is browsing that particular network at the moment i understand that they were probably created for organizational purposes but would almost make more sense to just have them as categories under stack overflow keep them separated but still connected instead of making people have to create multiple account 's one for each network i am sure there was a very good reason to break them up but as someone that is new to se it can be somewhat intimidating to decide which one to post in to ensure you get a good answer for example if i am a computer science student my first instinct might to be to post in the computer science network until i see that it literally has 1 of the users as the stack overflow network which still seems to be for science related questions so my second instinct would then to be to post it into the so network on the basis that i have a significantly higher chance of my question being seen and getting a good answer with 100x the users then i notice that there is also a programmers network and i do even begin to know where that fits in i and i am assuming most people will probably just post in the so network to be safe my question is other then the short little description blurb of each one is there a clear cut set of guidelines which what each network is intended for what kinds of questions should go to each one and is anything being done to encourage people to post in these newer smaller more specialized networks as opposed to just posting in big daddy stack overflow now again this is for computer why is this code doing what i want related questions i am not saying that if i had a question about linux or wordpress or something i would have the same confusion	where can i ask android related questions in stack exchange i would like to know where i can ask android apps and other mobile related questions is there a stack exchange site for such questions

true	what purpose does downvoting questions serve i understand the purpose of answers some answers are better than others some answers may be wrong  with regard to questions though there are other mechanisms to deal with bad questions comments close flag a poorly written question should be improved a bad question should be often though i see poorly written questions downvoted i 'm not sure what this accomplishes i get loss of rep for offensive or spam questions but for an off-topic question or one that is just poorly written why it seems to me that rep ought to be based more on answers on a site of this type fundamentally it seems that rep ought to be based on what you add to the site not what you ask of it a particularly good question does add to the site but a poor question does really detract from it in the same way that a bad wrong answer does sure go ahead and give people more rep for asking a particularly good question but why punish people for asking bad questions when there are other ways of handling that why not handle questions more like comments and allow upvotes but not downvotes it seems to me that many if not most of the downvoted questions are first timers it 's more likely that your first introduction to the site will be in asking a question rather than answering there is a significant risk to alienating new users when their questions are downvoted there 's a visceral response to seeing that negative number next to your question why not let the system weed out questions that do belong and the comment system work to improve poorly worded questions	do negative vote counts on questions really make sense possible duplicate what purpose does downvoting questions serve it seems like an off-topic question will get a few negative votes in addition to eventually being closed is closing the question punishment enough for the user should they really also lose reputation this seems very discouraging to new users where every point of reputation is hard-won

true	what can be done to improve moderation of self-answered questions about a month ago we rolled out a new feature instant self-answered questions so far the reception has been mostly positive and i 've definitely seen some really good stuff posted in this form but i 've also seen something else a side-effect you may have seen discussed here on mso is stack overflow a central store for tutorials why was my answer converted to a comment ignore for a moment the specific details of the pairs discussed in those two posts and note the following three poorly-asked questions questions that ordinarily would have been closed down-voted edited but instead sparked a small outrage among the members who came across them now we 've known for years that self-answered questions can be problematic asking is hard answering is hard asking a question when you already know the answer can be even harder to do well but that is or rather that should be beside the point plenty of people ask really terrible questions without bothering to answer them and we 've certainly managed to handle them over the years if normal community-moderation is failing when it comes to self-answered questions that 's a problem these are edge-cases at the moment but if we 're trying to encourage more use of this form to share knowledge on stack exchange and we are it 's something that needs to be faced i 'm presenting one possible solution below in true gratuitous self-answer fashion but what do you think would some other option work better is this even a real problem	more article style question format as you know when you ask your question on stack exchange you can then and there answer it yourself as well i had a major issue with iframes in ios safari i found the solution and my boss wanted me to detail the problem and solution so other developers in our company could avoid it as well well i thought i 'd do it through stack exchange and share my results with the wider web as well but this happened how to get an iframe to be responsive in ios safari i really expected no one to answer the question but some one did and my answer was pushed down so i have two problems with this it took me three hours to write this and i intended the question and answer to be read in sequence in essence you can criticise this and say i wrote an article but you try to come up with good question for something like this especially when you already know the answer this was the best i could think of state the problem in the question state the solution in the answer but it 's still intended to be read as a continuous text more like an article than anything else the second issue is that the answer given by the other user is incorrect i tested it and now there is this incorrect answer between my question and correct answer that was intended to be read in sequence with the question so i would like to propose this when a style question is posted the ops will remain together unless another answer has more up votes in fact i would think it would be more correct for them to remain together permanently unless the op answer receives down votes but i do not think that would fly well on stack exchange when a style question is posted the op 's answer will be automatically accepted when something like this is done the op already is the correct answer it 's possible that someone will give a better answer but if that happens the accepted answer can simply be replaced not to mention it 's highly unlikely for something like that to happen i think this would make sense because this would discourage and yes i know taboo answering half ass answers like the one i got when someone answers an already accepted question they always put more thought into it and basically keeps down noise and yes i am using the term noise here because when the is posted it 's usually with a good solution that works

true	editor toolbar not showing up possible duplicate wysiwyg editor missing recently the editor toolbar on stack overflow has been showing up for me it is on this site though  what 's going on it 's really annoying not to be able to format code seems to be happening both with chrome and ie also the handle at the bottom of the text area which is used for re-sizing is missing	strange behavior while trying to edit a question possible duplicate editor toolbar not showing up today i was trying to edit a question and i was not able to see the tools tab i had to simply press the escape to get back from the edit mode but when i pressed the escape key i ran into this why did this occur what was going wrong i am using google chrome running on linux
true	fastest gun in the west problem i feel like there 's a problem with stack overflow as the number of people prowling it increases each question 's answers are sorted by descending score and then by descending time of posting this means that if a person sits down and answers a question in a long thorough way going through every nook and cranny once they post their answer it will already be one of about seven different ones some of which have already been upmodded this would be a problem if those answers were as thorough as the one this guy 's posting but they usually are some of them are downright wrong some are even answers to the question asked because their poster did bother to read the question all the way through this causes a problem i like to call stack overflow 's fastest gun in the west problem i 've come to a point where i 'd rather just send a short simple correct explanation than to go and do some proper research write a whole blog post about it or even make sure the code i post even compiles just so it will be noticed as opposed to the incorrect ones i 'm sure i 'm not the only one doing this and that it despairs many people from even trying to answer questions i 've long ago learned to try to always raise a problem with a solution in hand rather than just say this is a problem handle it so my question after this long tirade is how do you think this can be changed what would you change in stack overflow to make this problem go away without hurting the site i promise to vote on answers i like even if it takes you a long while to post them 	using a quick post to get the top then editing possible duplicate fastest gun in the west problem i 've noticed an interesting behavior on stack overflow of late it goes like this after a question i see several very quick and dirty answers mostly they are incomplete or not very elaborate within about 15 minutes those answers are edited to be much more complete often incorporating ideas from later answers it would appear that users are posting quick and dirty to get the top slot then going back and modifying their answer within the first 15 minutes or so to incorporate other replies now if the poster checks compulsively they may also see the behavior but if they post go get coffee and come back then they come back to a very well thought out answer as the top post this seems to me as a way to game the system and get ranking by snagging the top post then incorporating the wisdom of others and it 's not just low rank people doing it i 've seen it twice by people with over 25k rep making me wonder how much of that rep was just their ability to quickly grab edit
false	is system an official product of the se network possible duplicate report se content copiers here yesterday i stumbled upon an answer i gave on but on a completely different website after investigating a bit further it seems that this site is just mirroring questions and answers from the se network in different categories with no mention whatsoever to se is this website related in any way to se in any case i do appreciate the fact that there are ads on the website meaning that the author is making money on author 's people contribution	markdown-quotes inside html are breaking the output this post appears totally messed up for me it uses many blockquotes that apparently lead to the link beeing spread all over the post-text including the flag edit link and at urls the answer 's text uses markdown-quotes inside a html-tag i guess this somehow messes up the output a href this is a really big button this is what firebug shows as you can see the link from the question is spread over the whole answer

false	make accepted check more distinct from non-accepted check on own questions i am viewing one of my own questions which has an accepted answer in the android app the checkmark for the accepted answer could be more distinct from those in the non-accepted answers the former is a green check in a white field while the others are a white check in a field with the same shade of green here 's a screenshot it was a bit confusing and i had to confirm on my pc which answer was the accepted one could this distinction be more clear perhaps simply no checkmark for the non-accepted answers	how much reputation do you need to be worth using it seems like stackoverflow careers 1 claim to fame is that it is associated with your stackoverflow profile and lets hiring managers use that as a signal of who is a quality developer my question is how active of a user of stackoverflow do you need to be for that to be a significant benefit i assume if your reputation is 1 and you 've never answered a question it is pointless at what point is it worth it 50 reputation about the top 34k so users 100 reputation top 25k 500 reputation top 10k so has about 100k users at this time so you can replace k with if you want
false	missing entries in most viewed in 10k tools super user does not have the huge traffic stack overflow has but this week a question got 243k views in just 3 days however even though this question right now still gets 500 views per hour the most viewed list in the 10k tools does not show that in the stats for today and nor did it yesterday when still at views per hour likewise not for the last 2 days only when looking at 7 days or more one gets to see it this makes me wonder about the other entries in the list and how we could validate that the question was originally migrated from stack overflow but i doubt that matters	remove nag screen for moderators when closing a question with a bounty on it currently if a moderator tries to close a question with a bounty on it they are presented with the following nag screen at this point a moderator has to go to the mod tools remove the bounty and then close the question this should be streamlined so that when a moderator closes a question with a bounty the bounty is automatically removed and refunded and the question is then closed right now the screen is nothing more than a nag for moderators and does serve any practical purpose

false	open source versus open-source i find the tags open and source confusing when used together to denote open-source yet there seem to be many questions tagged this way see many of the posts in am i missing some hidden meaning also open makes sense by itself when working with files but does source make sense by itself note that there is already source-code	effect of split on consecutive day counts it appears that consecutive day counts are tracked separately between main sites and their corresponding meta site how will the split affect the consecutive day count on meta stack overflow that is will we carry the mso count to the new mse profile so my 77 days on mso become 77 days on mse keep the mso count on the mso profile even though the meta site will be brand-new or exhibit a different behavior

true	how many down-votes is enough for a user to understand their problem i am wondering what users should do if they encounter a question that has already been down-voted for a particular reason if you agree with the down-vote should you down-vote the question as well for example this question was recently posted it was an obvious duplicate and should not have been asked so within several minutes 8 down-votes were cast and many comments about it being a duplicate were added my question is why do you agree that after one or two down-votes the poster would get the point what purpose does a 8th down-vote serve other than to embarrass the poster is a duplicate question really that offensive it 's not like he kicked a puppy i searched the faq and could find no guidelines on this should there be a guideline for piling on like this should the site somehow prevent this sort of thing one of the strengths of stack overflow is that it is self-policing so many members truly care however i am disappointed by this type of behavior and feel that it 's giving the site a bad reputation	should questions having lots of downvotes be downvoted further is down-voting an already heavily question kind of like kicking a dead horse is this bad practice

true	reduce delay in light of it 's ok to ask and answer your own questions it seems that we ought to be able to accept our own answers within the same time limits as accepting someone else 's answer of course this notion has been discussed here before when times were different mind you why must i wait 2 days before accepting my own answer auto accept self answer if no other answers are provided in two days allow accepting my own answer without waiting 48 hours in light of accept rate the crux of the blog post was that it 's not only acceptable but encouraged to accept your own answer when you find your own solution i can accept someone else 's answer to my question in as little as 15 minutes surely i should be able to accept my own answer i have no rep to gain from this and the community is better off knowing that there 's a solution to my problem or answer to my question if there 's concern about lots of spam here perhaps this can be a privileged operation say with 5k rep you can accept your own answers as if they were someone else 's answer one alternative to rep limits would be if previously self-accepted answers questions with self-accepted answers have received upvotes indicating a user is capable of asking and answering their own questions to the satisfaction of the community the rationale for my complaint is that lately i 've been asking extremely long-tail questions for low-use on the site and receive not only low views but no comments or other answers this leaves me searching for my own solutions so when i find them i write up reasonable answers that add value to the site that make the web a better place and that ultimately i should have to manage any differently than any of my other questions at the time of posting my last question had 7 views and hits 1 on google for a general query	approve self-answer quicker right now if i ask a question and later on that day or the next i find a solution and no other answers were posted or solved that question i will post my own answer if it 's the solver what i do get is why i have to wait 2 days to approve it it just makes me forget about the question and i wo always get back to it later lowering my acceptance rate and leaving an unanswered question in attention i see it as no different than asking a question and marking answer my own question at the bottom actively answering it immediately i think there should be no delay to approving own answers or make it significantly smaller than 2 days

false	bias against regular expression questions are regular expression questions not welcome at so why here are two threads regex match failure i replied to this unanswered four month old question only to receive immediate down votes with the explanation that the user should be using regex i do discount that advice for certain scenarios but the user wanted a regex answer and was given one then there is this question where it was closed after one hour regex with different rules for first and subsequent characters closed i replied to the user to try the msdn regex forum in the comments since the post was closed learning regular expressions creates questions just like net linq but you do see those questions closed should that question be moved to code review instead now two questions do indicate a pattern but something is amiss when it comes to regex learning regex requires asking questions to which stack overflow seems like an appropriate place to ask them am i wrong i get that people have personal preference to not use regular expressions and that is fine but when moderators or persons of stature apply their bias in stack overflow i believe that goes against the spirit of stack overflow thoughts	responding to your too localized concerns as part of our closing overhaul we 've moved reorganized and renamed a number of close reasons including too localized while that change was informed both by widespread misuse of the reason and numerous meta posts from you many of you have also indicated concerns about its new home in the off-topic menu and when you 're concerned we usually are too so we wanted to provide a little more background and more importantly set up a place where you can share any gaps you 're finding once the changes roll out network wide tl dr if you find examples that tl used to cover but that ca be addressed by the new off-topic reasons post them as answers here if you want more background on why something needed to be changed read the large number of words below did tl clear out many bad questions sort of it definitely helped us eliminate some bad questions and we need to make sure we deal with those but it was the least frequently used close reason a recent sample found it used on roughly of total questions asked on stack overflow with similar network stats but reviews of sampled questions by mods and staff found that roughly half of tl closures probably should not have been closed meaning its correct use was affecting roughly of questions for perspective all closed questions were about 12 of those asked in its current form it seemed to be causing as much harm as good on average you 'd have to read just over 150 questions before you encountered a single one of these that 's not to say that we should ignore those questions or do care about closing them just that the total volume they represent while not trivial also ai overwhelming but the real issue is that it was working consistently what was wrong the two main problems with the old reason were no one really agreed on what it meant and it attracted false positives from trigger-words locations its description had three parts and the first two parts were very broken only relevant to a small geographic area there are extremely few questions that need to be closed due to locational constraints that are closable for other reasons and no one ever agreed on what small meant or even what units to use this was a distraction from the real need limited to a specific moment in time again there was no even semi-consistent standard some people felt that meant days others months some sites applied it to any beta which seems reasonable until you remember that gmail was in beta for five years questions that are obsolete definitely need to be addressed but most technical questions will eventually suffer that fate so making everyone pick their own definition of how short is too short before that happens was working the third part was more generalized unlikely to help any future visitors or an extraordinarily narrow situation not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet this is starting to get to the heart of why tl was important now the old wording did invite debate over when to use it the first clause seems to require just that one person other than you could benefit 2 people total while the second one suggests that some meaningful percentage of all internet users should as of today 1 of all internet users would be 24mm people but setting aside the lack of a clear line is that concept useful it is the core of it sounds like the generalized too narrow which some have suggested should be a network-wide reason like too broad but too broad has a line we 're comfortable with answerable in several paragraphs there 's still some room for interpretation but we 're all on the same planet but while we do really like the idea of too narrow because it speaks to our belief that the best questions are those that benefit more people too narrow is very very hard to establish even a rough guideline for which is why our top users are still interpreting it wildly differently even within individual sites how do we retain all the good stuff too localized was doing something important it was being used quite helpfully to allow sites to cull the specific types of one-off questions that their experts did want the most common of these by far was code dump find my typo questions on stack overflow where the author provides a huge block of code or a broken site 's url with little more than why not working they should be closed but it 's actually a lot easier to close them as a specific off-topic reason because it eliminates all those silly debates about whether someone else might make the same typo or how many helpees are required instead we say our definition of our topic has explicitly excluded that we 're not debating anything our store simply does sell that thing we 've refined our definition of what 's on-topic here the headline may be programming but what we mean is programming but not code dumps programming but not whiteboard problems programming tools yes programming snacks no it 's really not all that different than the way other sites over time identified the specific question types they do want and made them off-topic gaming but not name that game photography but not fix this picture cooking recipe replacements yes cooking recipe requests no most of those could fall under too localized but it actually makes more sense to make them part of the definition of the topic because it makes their closure less subject to interpretation what now post any gaps as answers here we hope the above helps make some of you less worried as we do think this will actually work better for the key good uses of tl but we 're still a little worried about gaps if you find a question that previously fell under tl but for some reason ca easily be dealt with through off-topic post it as an answer here so we can follow up and adjust as needed for sites other than so you may want to discuss it on your local meta first to get community consensus but that 's up to you
true	improve the code tag highlighting possible duplicate syntax highligting does not properly support comment when you try to put a code you put it into a code tag but some programming languages have problems with this like when you put a that represents a comment in visual basic language the code that put all the the other code highlighted as a comment and ends when you put one more like you can see here here is a string declaration dim test as string here ends a string declaration please put something that you have to specify what is the programming language that is in the code tag to improve the visual element thanks	so syntax highlighing possible duplicate improve the code tag highlighting i posted the following on so and as you see everything after appears as a comment while its not so it would be a could thing to auto detect language or let user select language type

true	let questions stay open for a minimum amount of time before being closed feature request make questions unclosable until one hour after they 've been asked with an exception for flagged questions question what reason can you give for a non-abusive but otherwise bad question being closed as soon as possible bonus points for explaining the rationale behind your answer rebuttal since closed questions can still show up on various lists the implication is that deletion is the goal of closing a question since a question ca be deleted for two days see shog9 's comment in this answer why the fuss about delaying the closing of a question for a relatively small number of minutes the notion that the ratio on the home page outweighs all other considerations assumes that most people answer questions mainly from there i almost never use the home page preferring the newest or active tabs or using a tag seeing as the number of closed questions is so low i 'd hesitate to call them pollution i would guess that less then 10 of any of the regular lists consists of closed questions also it seems that it is much easier to close a question than to reopen one if you disagree i invite you to put your reasons in an answer or a comment before doing so with a downvote related question reputation penalty for closing a question that gets reopened	delaying closes depending on reputation to solve the citizen patrol negative effect possible duplicate let questions stay open for a minimum amount of time before being closed i 'm a stackoverflow user for a little more than one year now and i have the feeling that the site quality to get answer to questions and usefull programming related stuff is currently entering a fast degradation process at least by my standards for some kind of questions the site is becoming useless at least for me because questions are closed faster than answered two examples from my own questions some weeks ago i stumbled on a very good old programming book from the seventies programming proverbs from ledgard ok to me it looked like very good stuff but a bit oudated so i asked on stack overflow what is the current state of the art about this kind of practical programming rules of thumb which works which do not apparently there was some likely minded fellows as i got some answers but nevertheless it was closed in a matter of minutes belongs to programmers maybe but on programmers the question was also closed fast enough as duplicate for great programming quotes which is true it 's like if a question asking about names of mammals was closed as duplicate of a question about dictionnary words worse the answers i got from programmers were indeed useless junk that comforted me in my feeling it was definitely not the right place to ask it ok i assumed the way i asked my question was bad that it missed a bit of context examples ok my fault in the last weeks i also asked two other questions very narrow focused and specific those were not immediately closed but i did get much useful stuff either in answers now i asked another question today which is about a problem encountered by a fellow programmer he has to remotely change a password on a windows box from some acl program running on a linux box any programming language available on linux would do after googling a few minutes i also found out that the problem was likely to be solved by calling some samba code either through command line tools python wrapper library wmi-client or maybe some other entry point i have no idea about this one was also closed fast enough a matter of hours as off-topic what i 'm feeling that there is people on so who are spending their time to close as many questions as they have close points is there a badge for that  we may call them the closing patrol they are laso doing it with very low standards i 'm wondering if they even bother to carefully read questions before voting to close there also seems to be a sheep effect as soon as a question get a first close vote it is not long before it gets the other four close vote maybe subsequents closers feels less guilty  the problem is that there is no similar effect for reopening questions new questions have some kind of visibility but old closed questions are just buried now i invested some time answering other 's questions on so or upvoting good questions and answers i 'm really pissed to see that a handful of people can so easily forbid be to ask questions in any community as large as so there will be people with varying standards on what should or should not be asked the problem is that people with the most exclusive standard will always rule even having read the faq on close policy is not mandatory to close i feel this is not contributing to overall site quality ok that is the problem now i have something to suggest to solve that problem when closing a question time is of the essence why not let questions live for some time before letting people vote to close them this time could easily be made a parameter say as many minutes as the user has points that would make questions from jon skeet impossible to close for a year or mine stay alive for a few days but i do not really see that effect as a problem edit i 'm answering here to some comments as i have not enough reputation to comment back i 'm not pretending my questions should not be closed and i can as easily point out closed questions of other people in another thread on meta i even complained some questions by others where closed while i was editing my answer to them i 'm definitely shocked by this overall fast close behavior i see very little benefit in close feature i understand when in some cases a question has too many answers it should not get more but if a question belongs to another stackexchange site it should not be closed but migrated or if it belongs nowhere or is spam deleted and in that case migraters should certainly read the questions they move to some other site or they will come back duplicates are in some cases a precious ressource at it attracts attention to subjects whose answers are often incomplete the question got out of visibility before getting good answers or outdated the main effect of closing questions is forbidding people willing to answer some question to do it as if downvoting the question to make it less visible was not enough are people doing this believing that by forbidding answers to some questions ressources will answer to some other question at least for me that is not true when questions are closed as i am typing an answer or willing to and this is really getting more frequent i 'm pissed of and usually go away from so for some time i wonder if i am the only one to react this way and i agree getting a reputation of a few thousand points is not hard i also depends on subjects people interrested in net or java are getting point more easily as community are bigger but it usually means some kind of involvment anyway considering the current closing policy i 'm even wondering if i should create some puppet account to ask questions or if my policy should be to always put a bounty when asking a serious question and wanting to avoid immediate close

false	decision on rejected edits should be displayed as a notification to the editor update april 2014 i fully support shog9 's proposal of adding the message where it belongs in the actual editing form this is less intrusive than displaying it as a notification but it serves the same purpose can has background when you suggest an edit the outcome of whether it was approved or rejected is buried deep within your profile you have to navigate to profile activity suggestions to find a list of your recent edits but even those do not say anything about the outcome waffles introduced this to facilitate learning but what can i learn from this page i have to manually click through the edits to see whether they were rejected or not this is time-consuming or inefficient at best there 's also no learning involved at all since there is no active feedback feature request 1 if an edit was rejected there should be a notification message displayed linking to the page of the suggested edit which states the reject reason this kind of feedback would improve the editing behavior since otherwise inappropriate suggestions might just continue feature request 2 if the above is too intrusive the messages in the profile 's activity section should be clearer for example like this compare against the first screenshot in the question this is similar to improving how suggested edits are displayed in your activity history here 's some more explanation let 's assume the case of a user suggesting lots of edits that are in some way harmful maybe they were too minor like only changing keyboard shortcuts to use kbd markup instead of boldface yes we 've already had this on super user since it only takes one user to approve reject there some of these edits might even have been wrongfully accepted others rejected while this is a problem of its own the user suggesting these edits will have a hard time even getting any kind of feedback they would never see the rejection messages because they 're buried somewhere unless they critically checked each suggestion in their profile i doubt anybody would do this even more so they might only look at their steadily climbing reputation not really noticing a rejected edit another case is users learning how to edit how are we going to guide them if they 're not told what they did wrong they will just continue suggesting edits until somebody actually pings them in chat or comments somewhere here 's an example of a user who was completely unaware that he could see feedback somewhere in a dark corner of his profile until he was banned from editing because he 'd repeated the same mistake over and over	april fool 's day changes should be based on the user 's time zone no this is a duplicate of all the normal make badges and the rep cap day local requests it 's very specific to april 1st users should be required to specify their time zone next time they log in to stack overflow do try to guess it from javascript that will be ambiguous do present a list lazy users will just pick a random entry insist on both the windows system id for the time zone and the olsen database name that way there 's no room for ambiguity if a user ca get a valid combination after 3 attempts suspend them they 're clearly not trying hard enough allow a user to change their time zone only when the date of their current time zone is the same as the date within the new time zone periodically confirm their time zone by giving them pop quiz on when their dst will next change if at all then and only then can we make sure that any april fool 's day specific features show up at the right time

false	how do tags influence stack exchange 's seo how do tags influence stack exchange 's seo on rpg we 've noticed we do get as much traffic from google as we would expect at this point one of the reasons we think this may occur is that our terms are often long have ampersands and otherwise do match what people are searching on for example dungeons dragons fourth edition dungeons dragons essentials mutants masterminds second edition are common games our most active tag is dnd-4e this is a common search term in google a much more common term is 4 or dungeons and dragons 4 a search on dnd-4e has questions pretty high in the list but of course due to the 25-character limit and no special characters our tagging options end up diverging from what people may search on in addition people generally use the tags to avoid having to say all that stuff in their subject do our tags have a lot of influence on how we 're presented to google should we be double-tagging items as and dnd-4e to try to get the seo is there some other solution to this problem our site gets some decent seo but not near as much as it should be for the content on it as compared to other rpg sites	if i solve someones problem instead of answering their question should i post a comment instead i posted this answer to a question where someone was trying to use regex to parse html the question was how can i get my regex to work and my answer was do use regex use this instead should i have posted my answer as a comment
true	why was suggested edit rejected by community the suggested edit corrected formatting issues in the code posted by the op in the initial post you can see line breaks in the code posted most of the time when someone rejects a suggested edit a proper reason is given like this edit is too minor suggested edits should be substantive improvements addressing multiple issues in the post  should community also provide some reason while rejecting suggested edits update another similar example a reviewer frank approves and community rejects ofcourse without sharing any reasons	community rejecting suggested edits aka community gone astray community rejected the following edit i resubmitted a similar edit which was approved i think community was on a coffee break this is the revision history of the question now i had noticed that the op deleted the question for a short time is the reason community rejected the edit because of the deletion or is there another reason what does one do when community has rejected a valuable edit why was the suggested edit approved the second time around
false	what constitutes a typo after reading about the campaign to close questions pertaining to typos i have to ask what constitutes a typo for example i 'm learning about writing shell scripts in linux bash apparently bash is really picky about syntax and as such var 5 is wrong while var 5 is right took me a while to realize what i was doing wrong had this same problem with if 's and loops and so questions such as this one were very useful in figuring out the issue however that question 's answer you forgot the spaces seems to me to be along the same lines of you forgot a semicolon are questions such as this going to be closed i feel there 's a difference between someone forgetting a single item they should know such as a brace or semicolon and helping to explain the nuances of syntax i would really like to keep these kinds of questions around where does the line lie apologies if a more concrete answer has already been decided i looked at the initial request but did see more than talking about single character issues	more aggressive tag match between reviewed question and reviewer activity when reviewing i was very pleasantly surprised to receive questions that match my most active tags i suppose it 's by design and it 's a great thing but i also receive a lot of questions that really do not match my knowledge i am a computer vision guy and i am asked to review json php ruby etc some are easy to interpret they are plain crap but others need some sort of knowledge in the area to make a clear judgement especially the suggest improvement part is compromised so i suggest to limit more aggressively the questions whose tags do not match the reviewer 's expertise i see other were concerned about the topic on both pro and contra arguments please allow tag filtering on the new review pages and random sort order on review pages but i think that a good formula would be a biased random order towards the implicit user preferences it should limit the not sure clicks my a measurable amount edit to make a clear distinction between the related that handle manual sort by tags i am talking about automatic filtering based on reviewer 's most active tags
true	should hi thanks taglines and salutations be removed from posts i edit a lot of posts every day i often run across posts with hi and thanks on the top and the bottom of the post respectively i also run across things like user should these items be removed during the editing of the post by an editor	is adding a signature considered spamming possible duplicates should hi thanks and taglines and salutations be removed from posts what is the policy on signatures and links in answers for stack overflow questions i would like to add a signature to all my answers i would consider this fair use when i spend time answering questions the signature would of course contain a link and obviously yes it is for improving the page rank
true	the robo-approvers are killing my will to review edits already i have lost all hope of looking at late answers it 's just a parade of meh i ca make any kind of intelligent decision because i ca see the other answers to the question for instance there 's no looks good only skip and those feel different to me so i 've been more interested in reviewing edits but people keep approving crap while i 'm looking at it two or three the post was already approved please visit to edit and i 'm just screw this whole thing can we do something like one reject bounces all existing votes you need three approves in a row because a lot of people are stupidly approving and actually driving me away from the queue note this is less about letting bad edits through and more about keeping reviewers motivated	too many edits get approved i 've recently noticed that many of my posts get edited by new users and the edits are subsequently approved often unanimously great right yes except that many of these edits are spurious or wrong the first kind irks me somewhat but is tolerable the second kind not so much here are two examples from the last day how can i check if a file is empty the edit does invalidate the answer it 's just completely superfluous i do particularly resent it i just think it should have been approved that 's not what edits are for why should files end with a newline the editor apparently confused the words expect and except no biggie but all but one reviewer did notice this that 's not review it 's just clicking ok i realise that there are already measures in place to catch noop reviewers but they do seem to be working particularly well at least as far as i can tell i have no solution i just wanted to offer this anecdote for consideration

false	making my own se-ish site about 7 months ago i was hired to the company i work at now i was asked to bring some new ideas to the table i instantly thought of a site similar to stackoverflow to target our marketed industry i quickly pulled up the site and my new employer said yes i want that my memory told me that stackexchange was selling licenses for the product and we could make a quick and easy integration well i had been on hiatus from so at the time and was unaware of the new democratic area51 and the new site creation policies my boss decided he still wants something like it and i offered to develop it from scratch my only concern is legal implications from having a similar structure to stackoverflow and ending up with a fat lawsuit on my pink slip we want to take advantage of everything from reputation to tags i would propose an area51 site but we want this to be in house and be able to use it as a marketing tool and sync our existing users with the program i have no intent to stomp on any toes but i 'm actually very excited about the project i suppose my question is what can i not do that stackexchange does how do i make a format without cheesing off the community and making enemies on the network what sort of legal guidelines should i follow to avoid infringing on the current setup of se	answering down-voted off-topic un-constructive and generally bad questions i am very active on and i see there many questions that are either off-topic un-constructive or simply a request for code samples my first reaction is obviously to flag and then to place a comment reminding the user what questions to ask or to be more specific  these questions are usually down-voted fairly quickly and in most cases closed and even deleted however many new users looking to up their rep wont hesitate to answer what would be the best way to discourage users from answering a question that clearly should not be answered in its current form update would it be acceptable to down-vote such answers even if they are valid and include a comment explaining why this question should not have been answered

false	does the asker have the right to modify his question i just came across a question where the question asker slightly modified his question but was not allowed to here 's the revision history it was pointed out to the asker that one of his code segment does compile and it makes no sense to ask difference between a compiling code and non-compiling code i believe this was the reason that question received 4 downvotes otherwise it 's not such a bad question and would have received 4 downvotes imo asker edited the question saying removed the first one which gave a compiler error my bad asker 's edit was rolled back with the reason i 've rolled it back because all answers reference both example lines of code so they should both remain regardless of their correctness it 's not that the asker changed the entire content of the question he just modified an offending which part which accumulates downvotes for him and he did in quick time too 3-4 minutes now the broader question is it ok to not allow an asker change question even if it changes the original context slightly and may make some or part of answers irrelevant i have always thought it 's the answerer 's responsibility to the answer if the question has been modified and his answer became irrelevant what 's the consensus on this	merge data-attribute into i suggest merging data-attribute into they both refer to html5 data attributes and i think custom data attributes is the correct name see and the latter tag has a wiki page already

false	require two clicks to join a chatroom there are two camps with very different positions regarding how users should be treated when they join a chat room if you join a chat room you 've signed on to be addressed by random people and bots it 's expected that you may be pinged by anyone or anything if you join a chat room you 're lurking until you talk you 've only dipped your toes into the water i 'm in camp 2 and the main reason is that joining a chat room is very lightweight it happens as soon as you click the big link in the room description i 'm not too happy that provided that you 're logged into chat and have enough reputation to talk clicking the big link makes you appear in a very visible manner into the list of participants in the room i would mind as much if joining a chat room was truly an active decision if it was something that happened as soon as you wanted to have a look yes there 's a link to the transcript but it 's rather small and hidden changing the main link to the transcript would solve the problem browsing the transcript is discreet however i do think this is an acceptable solution because it would make actually joining the room a common action too much work what i propose instead is the following when you click on the main link in a room description the display is similar to what it is now when you do have the reputation to participate in the room or are logged in at all you get to see messages appearing in real time and the screen layout is the same as if you were in the room the bottom part of the screen should show a message like click here to participate i 'm not hung on the wording if you click you get to join the room with your avatar appearing in the participant list if you start typing then send button and the other buttons appear and posting a message also joins the room if you 've talked in a room recently clicking on the main link for that room directly makes you an active participant the first click is merely clicking on a link whose text is the room name which does hint that this is an active public action so it does have any effect that 's visible to other people the second click clearly tells the user that he 's about to participate and participating in a chat is by definition public since others may talk to you this provides a lightweight way to make joining a chatroom less accidental than it is now it solves the problem of users being jumped on as soon as they click the link to a chat room now they wo be jumped on until they deliberately jump in	is updated on answer deletion is the value of the property of a question object updated when an answer for the question is deleted for example when there are 2 answers for a question no edits to the question and when the newer answer of the 2 is deleted will the post timestamp of the other answer overwrite the of the question

true	should i flag old questions after reading of should i vote to close old questions i wonder if the answer also applies to flagging of old questions i have the subjective feeling the longer the time between the question and the flagging is the longer it takes to become reviewed is flagging of old posts a waste of moderator time should i avoid that	please discourage flags on old questions and answers the flagged posts tool is frequently cluttered with not an answer or low quality flags on questions and answers from 2008 and 2009 i 've recently counted 17 and 13 such flagged questions or answers out of the 50 randomly shown stack overflow is not the site it used to be it does seem productive to me to try to hold ancient posts to standards that did not yet exist some old answers should have been comments but i think were made before comments were implemented so i propose adding a polite unicorn when a user flags an old post examples very low quality code smells in non oo forms geochet 's answer is definitely lacking in description but a would probably do better than flagging not an answer is there a good interactive 3d graph library out there is there a good interactive 3d graph library out there these answers and two more since deleted by robert might have been wrong but they were at least suggesting libraries 2d-only rather than the 3d that the questioner requested that 's why they had negative votes but they were comments they were requests for more information they were just wrong incidentally the question is a poll today we 'd close and delete the entire question but in 2009 it got 11 answers and remains open today duplicate adding dictionaries in python was marked as a duplicate of python  i do think i 'd ever recommend marking a question as a duplicate of a code-golf question which we mostly throw over the fence these days but the code golf question got 8 answers back in 2009 and it remains open today summary those old questions and answers might not be perfection by today 's standards but they 've been picked over quite a bit already and i think we 've reached the point of diminishing returns our flagging and pruning efforts would probably be better spent on the contents generated in the last week
true	should tiny edits be accepted or rejected in review i regularly review suggested edits on the review page one common situation is that a user will propose a tiny edit like capitalising a single letter or removing only the salutation from a post in many cases there are still multiple further improvements that could be made but that editor has seen them or ca be bothered i feel uneasy accepting such edits on the one hand it reminds me of the army of twiddlers on wikipedia who spend their time making tiny inconsequential edits when they could be doing something much more useful it also feels lame to award someone any points at all for capitalising a single letter in a title i sometimes feel that this may be a kind of gaming of the system on the part of some users suggesting multiple small edits for point gain rather than just fixing the whole post i also see this with tag wiki editing on the other hand it is a valid edit and it does objectively improve the post there has been a prior ruling on part of this there was some substantial discussion about the aggressive removal of salutations during the rich b era remember that wonderful chap  i seem to remember that the conclusion was that removal of hi thanks on their own was not sufficient grounds for a post edit although i ca find that now this post is relevant but inconclusive i have been erring on the side of this edit is pointless and voting to reject but i notice i am often overruled by other reviewers perhaps one answer would be to provide a third option after insufficient what behaviour are we intending to reward here	should micro-editing for the sake of rep be discouraged i often find myself frustrated when reviewing suggested edits as too often they appear to be minor and insignificant stuff like adding backquotes on a single term making some of the words bold or removing a thank you if this is too obvious i just reject it but these edits are often still accepted by others who probably care less or think that even tiny edits are justified on top of that i can already recognize some users as serial editors and judging by their rep summary i can see they often reach the daily cap of edits in some cases most of their rep comes just from editing without questions or answers they 're hardly bounded by the 1000 max on editing since they 're under 2k anyway now i know the bonus is there to encourage making the site better and in most cases i think an edit totally deserves it and i usually approve helpful edits even if they 're minor things like indentation and formatting but i ca help thinking that we 've got a hole in the rep system should minor touch-ups on any 5 questions off the top of the list and there 's always something to edit especially junk questions really equal an upvote on a decent answer in some topics a good answer might get no more than 1-2 upvotes simply because there are enough people browsing them so what you get from taking the time to answer and explain if often less than what you could get by just editing random stuff is there a way to close this hole for add approve without rep button for cases where the edit does really merit it auto-detect tiny edits adding just backticks or changes for not including whitespaces used for code formatting and indentation lower the rep bonus reduce the cap for edits increase the min edit size currently 6 characters excluding whitespaces or is it perfectly acceptable activity and i should approve these edits without an afterthought

true	do too broad questions become less broad after an acceptable answer is given i came across this question in the review queue sometimes i come across questions of similar form my thought is to vote to close as too-broad because question is very broad there are many many ways to perform that task no code was posted no specific coding problem was identified but and this is in general i always get tripped up when i see that these questions have a reasonable accepted answer i would have voted it too-broad immediately had i seen the question pop up in the new questions stream but when i see that the answerer seemed to find the question clear enough and his answer was accepted and deemed satisfactory i end up going back and thinking if it was clear enough for the answerer to provide a specific answer does that mean it was too broad after all how should i handle questions like this and in general how should i handle questions that alone seem too broad but when answered seem specific should i ignore the answers when considering closing a question or do they retroactively change the quality of the question	close queue etiquette accepted answers and too broad and unclear what you 're asking questions recently during our whole push to burn down the close queue i came around a good load of questions that were flagged for too broad or unclear what you 're asking but also already answered and had accepted an answer while i could generally still see that the question was either too broad for our format or not really clear i wonder what the general consensus is here it might be a bit too broad for our minds but somebody else could and has answered it successfully sorry if this is a well establish thing but i could find any info on it

false	queued questions for a more user-friendly site feature description a personal question page as usual and a list which remain on the users profile to build the question leaving the question unpublished so one can come back to work on the question extend or minimize or discard when no solution is found anywhere and the problem remains the user can publish it and it will be to all people possible pros more generalized questions as research is made easier the question after finding information emphasizing this is a forum but a research site user-comfort thus one can focus on problem formatting the layout keeps the question clear providing already a possible answer actually two due to selection on this site keeping a clear desktop referring to new people to use this feature less duplicates or wrongly stated questions due to easy research closed due duplicates can be directly put into their own unpublished list to think delete or rephrase maybe down-voted too or new decline votes clearer acceptance why something is not ready but not disapproved thus preventing questions like how to delete my account i do like the policy where they only misunderstanding and where they can be a valuable source in time new people can find easy questions much sooner less duplicates so related are easier found less results they feel taken seriously or professional which they may be one day warm-hearted people make better marketing possible cons yet another server to fill reposting of declined questions more questions on meta conclusion the quality of the site will rise due to fewer questions but higher quality answers as questions are more qualified due to lesser questions duplicates are notice earlier this could have a recursive effect although it might seem to be a user feature or new-user help it is aiming at the overall quality of site	deletion by moderator i asked today if wrong answers should be flagged flagged wrong answer faq too unspecific and i cited an example with imho wrong answers now robert harvey deleted my answer on the very same question is this a valid float comparison that accounts for a set number of decimal places if the user wants to compare two floats using a set number of decimal points significant figures there is a simple but unfortunate answer it is not possible all other answers which say it is or provide algorithms are wrong naturally with the assumption that operations like and should provide correct decimal answers reason the decision to round either upward or downward depends if the next digit is either or as floats are always incorrect approximations to both values you simply cant either we would not have the need to use decimal or money classes the documentation even cites an example notes to callers because of the loss of precision that can result from representing decimal values as floating-point numbers or performing arithmetic operations on floating-point values in some cases the round double int32 method may not appear to round midpoint values to the nearest even value in the digits decimal position this is illustrated in the following example where is rounded to instead of this occurs because internally the method multiplies value by 10digits and the multiplication operation in this case suffers from a loss of precision and as float has only 24 bits it means that 16777216 you are screwing up if you use floats for decimal points edit because it seems that noone wants to see the problem here the proof the very first problem is that the algorithms here are broken almostequals f f 1 true the reason is that the original poster asked explicitly for equal decimal places but even if we use a special round function there is no way to escape the problem i used vc 2008 to print out the correct values of the function the first is the precision parameter the second the hex value of the resulting float and the third is the exact decimal value 1 3dcccccd 2 3c23d70a 3 3a83126f 4 38d1b717 5 3727c5ac 6 358637bd so you can try almostequals f f 1 or almostequals f 1 and show me a function which is able to get correct answers for both values and is generalizable i see here a little problem may i ask why even if you assume that my answer is not correct there is an answer it is no due to floating-point restrictions it is not possible to write a function which is able to work exactly as the author intended you may get a function which works sometimes i added the microsoft documentation of the round function which explicitly warns that the result will sometimes not work as expected i provided a counterexample of both suggested implementations almostequals f f 1 true i also printed out the results of the vc2008 implementation to show that the stepsizes do not fulfill the necessary conditions and show that it is in fact not possible to generate a function which satify both tests and can be generalized edit it was mentioned in the comments that the question is vague if this is the case then surely it is not the problem of my answer it applies to the question and the answers given but i cite now the op my original problem was that i wanted f f f to be true which returns false in but the implementation can be used to say that almost equals with 2 decimal places i 'm not concerned that would equal if you took 2 significant figures into account that 's what i meant about decimal places actually upon further reading it 's decimal-places i 'm trying to get at here not significant figures if you find the question vague tell me an alternative implementation for which almost equals with 2 decimal places and which wants decimal places not significant figures edit2 added the deleted answer because some people can not see it

false	should off-topic migration close votes be differentiated from others i 'm just wondering if the current sub-menu of options for questions link edit close 2 flag might be a bit alarming to new users who see their questions apparently about to be closed when in actual fact they 're just being gently transported as if held gracefully aloft on a beam of pure luxuriant joy to a more appropriate stack site in other words i wonder whether it might be wise to split out the normal close votes with those that recommend migration in the sub-menu so that it reads link edit close migrate 2 flag i realise that this would dilute the purity of the existing one close link to rule them all approach but i 'd personally say that migration is an odd fit in there anyway then again perhaps i 'm just tremendously mentally ill update i 've also noticed an increasing trend where off-topic questions that are ripe for migration to one of the existing listed sites are simply tagged as off-topic with no destination site specified the propsed migrate link would potentially go some way to resolve this	allow bounty immediately or at least before 48 hours possible duplicate why ca i just offer a bounty for a question right off the bat some of the questions i ask get no interest or traffic and only after a bounty is offered are answers posted i think that questions that have no answers after some shorter time period should be allowed to have a bounty before the 48 hour timeframe even if we could drop the wait to 6 0r 8 or 12 or 24 hours that would be preferable the arguments i have seen for similar questions against allowing immediate bounty do really hold much water
true	why are 15 reputation points required to upvote i think more reputation points should be required to add a new answer than to upvote an existing answer i do continually watch for new questions so usually when i find a question it has already been answered it seems bit inappropriate to answer an already-answered question in order to contribute to the conversation but until you earn reputation you ca upvote or comment you can only add new answers which prevents me from contributing at the moment as much as i would like to this seems backwards to me if someone incorrectly upvotes a bad answer the damage is minimal as other users can down vote it and upvote the correct answers on the other hand an incorrect answer wastes the time of everyone who reads it so imho it should require more reputation points to add an answer than to upvote or comment on an existing answer i would say say that users should be prevented from answering unanswered questions until they have x reputation points as that might prevent users who have answers from providing them but perhaps it should be required if the question is already answered to discourage users from reiterating previously given answers what do you think	why require reputation to rate a response possible duplicate why is 15 reputation required to upvote twice now i 've googled a question and the answer has been on stackoverflow both times my question was answered and i wanted to up-vote the answer that i found helpful but i ca do so until i have a 15 reputation so here i am asking why one must have a reputation to simply upvote of course i now have a screen showing me related questions the very first one list is why is 15 reputation required to upvote closed but i 'm still going to ask this repetitious question just so i can start getting reputation so that i can avoid repetition in the future and upvote an existing helpful answer to an existing question

false	why would moderators thwart my attempt to award a mistaken bounty to someone else so a couple of weeks ago i ran into something that i could figure out and i considered it a hard question so i posted a question on stackoverflow like i sometimes do i had planned on offering a bounty if there were no answers because i wanted something urgently however to my surprise it was answered within 30 minutes with a suggestion that solved my problem i decided to come back to the question and award a bounty to it because i was grateful when assigning the bounty i chose the option award existing answer in the message i wrote something to the effect of hey thanks for this answer it really helped me out here have 50 of my reputation yesterday i was working hard like i sometimes do i had a lot of browser tabs open opened another one to do a little google search for something would you know it was near the top of the results so i clicked on something that looked like it might be what i was after when the window opened it had a little red 1 indicating that i had something in my inbox i assumed it was the person who answered my question commenting on the bounty i was about to award them since i was busy but i hate seeing that little red 1 inbox icon i clicked it because i did want to lose my train of thought i clicked the confirmed it and hit the back button to go back to what i was doing so it turns out that i made a mistake and accidentally awarded the bounty to a new answer to the same question then i asked this question on meta where someone suggested i ask the person to delete their question so that the bounty could be refunded i did this and the answerer obliged but the deletion was undone by moderators to preserve the mistakenly awarded bounty i was also told it was a duplicate of this answered question however what i do not understand is if the whole point of raising a bounty on your question is to attract attention then why is one of the reason options when starting a bounty to reward existing answer one or more of the answers is exemplary and worthy of an additional bounty i had not created this bounty to attract answers i had simply done it to award an existing answer now it was only 50 points and i also awarded 100 to correct my mistake as suggested but i have given up trying to get anything back it 's really no big deal what i am still curious about though is why my attempt to reverse the bounty was thwarted by moderators according to this when an answer that received a bounty is deleted all reputation including the bounty are revoked this may take 5 minutes to be visible the bounty is not given back to the user who awarded it this is what i was able to accomplish by requesting it from the user it was awarded to but that action was undone by others why we all know that everyone makes mistakes so does a decent job of warning us with the alert can not be undone but that 's not really true because it can be so was my undo attempt undone because it would cause additional work for a developer to manually reverse the data was my attempt an exploitation of a loophole in the bounty system that needs to be closed is it because i am not really a so customer and that 's who they are focusing on ad placers and employers or some other reason	custom openid for sites on the ubuntu stack exchange site it would be really useful to be able to have a custom default openid provider so the stack exchange site can be used with the same login that ubuntu users are used to using for other ubuntu sites bugtracker forums etc would stackexchange be willing to support this

true	deleted answer still visible the following scenario happened to a question of mine today i asked a question to a topic i 'm pretty new to someone answered the question it absolutely satisfied my points so i upvoted and accepted it but a few minutes later he got heavily downvoted because as i understand it the way he explained the points were completely wrong and they said his words just show he has no clue about the topic so he deleted his answer which made me sad as i thought it will be lost but it was his answer is still in the question it has a weak colour as an answer has of my own after i deleted it but why is this just to me as i 'm the one who upvoted it or is it because at the point he deleted it it was the accepted answer and is this just visible to me or anyone can still see it and i also noticed he still has the rep he got left from his answer after downvoting so is this really a deleted answer what 's going on	why my answer was deleted i answered this question and automatically i was downvoted an the answer was deleted i think this is not correct the question can i use php reserved varible as my variable
true	bounty-like facility for rewarding excellent questions amongst the reasons for starting a bounty one can select reward existing answer one or more of the answers is exemplary and worthy of an additional bounty why not enable one to reward excellent questions in a similar manner	award a bounty to a question suppose i 'm helped from a question and would like to gift some points to that question there is the option to award a bounty to the answer in anyone 's question but i want to award some bounty to the question itself it 's different so it should say gift rather than bounty would you consider adding this feature
false	not getting analytical badge i viewed all the sections in the faq of stack overflow but have still not been awarded the analytical badge is it that i need to see all the faqs in meta programmers and other stack exchange sites this is not a duplicate question all the questions related to this i have seen however i did not find a satisfying answer	relative links are ignored by linked questions relative links to posts such as this one do not show up under linked see this query suggests that relative links to posts are used 1 as often as absolute links not an overwhelming rate but that still adds up to quite a lot of ignored links personally i 've used relative links pretty often it was slightly disappointing to realize that this habit had been counterproductive
false	changes to rep requirements for privileges like tag creation should be announced in the past users with more than 300 or so reputation points i do remember the exact number had the ability to create new tags those tags made it easier to search for similar questions and to identify the context of the questions i had created a few new tags for questions i asked now it seems the stack overflow team without prior notice to the users involved or any intimation of intent has revoked permission to create new tags and set the reputation for creating new tags to more than 1500 is this an act of bullying did the team feel it was required to inform all the registered users before making the changes	should last version x be a part of tag wikis as i was going through the suggested edits review queue i saw several edits which were just updating the last stable version part of tag wikis like this one so my question for meta is is it a good practice to put this information on tag wikis for very projects it might not change often but for many foss projects it 's always moving so it 's a chore to maintain and can become a way to harvest points
true	can we exempt downvoted accepted answers from getting the top spot similar to this request but narrower i 'm suggesting we make a particular exception for downvoted accepted answers those with score less than zero or some other threshold like so that they stay in the normal sort order and do jump to the top the accepted answer on this question on is at time of writing above an answer with which is quite a good score on our little site  it also does help things that the accepted answer is about a mile long so it takes a lot of scrolling to get past it	banner claim the best answers are voted up and rise to the top is not true i just saw the banner on so about here 's how it works claiming the best answers are voted up and rise to the top that is how i feel it supposed to be but this is not true not the best answer rises to the top but the answer one person likes is fixed to the top it does not matter if this answer is the worst possible or even simply wrong if you look through old questions you will find many questions where the second answer has a lot more votes than the top answer often this answer is truly better than the accepted the top answer is not democratic but a small despotism of the op there has already been questions about that but still some people believe the op is the only one facing a specific problem while that might be true for the second he answer a question it is officiously wrong on long term people face the same problem will google it and up vote what works for them op does not know it better as them i am not claiming to have a solution but i think the issue should be addressed

true	huge close votes review queue on stack overflow today the size of the close-votes queue is 55k questions and growing is that a problem which action could be taken to clean it up it seems to be growing faster than stack overflow members are capable to handle it	how to handle ever-increasing number questions pending closure in the review section ever since i gained 3000 rep on so i 've noticed that the number of questions pending review for closure has increased consistently it must have been 2 or 3 months ago that i first got rep to start reviewing questions and i 've noticed that number creep up from 50k to now almost 83k it 's clear the number of questions pending more close votes is creeping up and there 's literally thousands of questions that will never get touched but remain on the list every single other section of reviewable stays low consistently how do we tackle the endless in-stream of questions with close votes i understand that it 's common for a close vote or two to get slapped on a question and it gets left that way forever should we remove stale close votes that never ended up in an actual closure is so prioritizing newer questions over old ones when you actually start reviewing those questions maybe this is even an issue and i 'm not seeing it let me know what your thoughts are

false	is there a way to see your full comments history i want to find a question i commented on about two years ago is this possible	dissecting the stack overflow views counter the last couple of days i 've been trying to understand how the stack overflow page views counter works i wish to add a views counter to a project of mine and investigating the options stack overflow seems to be a good source of useful ideas needless to say i 've browsed through all of the related questions here on stack overflow and on meta stack overflow i ca say i 've found an explanation but some tips presumably false leading were given in this answer view counter in mvc from what i can tell there is now a javascript section in each answer page used to be css in 2008 the last part of the url a947 seems to be dynamically generated it is changed every 15-20 minutes and is the same for all questions and presumably users i tried anonymous access changing my ip address it stays the same during the interval in a comment to the answer did anyone notice that some sites seem to be so 's posts jeff atwood gave a bit of a hint our view counts are very very strict more akin to visits as they are unique per ip per 15 minute interval observing things with firebug reveals that this url always returns 204 no content so my first idea was that the browser is likely not to retrieve that counter url on subsequent page requests until the random code changes thus preventing duplicate counter hits already on the client side for that 15 minutes interval watching the things with firebug does seem to confirm that theory as you can see the counter url is retrieved again and again even if i do refresh the page with f5 but just click the page link in the title more to it i tried to recreate the same scheme in a test project also returning 204 and i confirm that the counter url is retrieved again and again no browser caching more peculiar firefox for some reason calls the url twice the number is always even at this point the idea behind this counter url is a mystery to me what is the point of that last changing part of the url if it 's the same for all questions and users and does not prevent repeated requests from the client-side in that question a possible explanation is given view counter in mvc i think i know the answer they are analyzing the iis log as ope suggested hidden image src is set to code random code is needed because many people may share the same ip address in a network for example and the code is used to distinguish users i 'm not sure i understand this and i somehow feel it 's off course can somebody or perhaps the stack exchange folks explain what and how they are doing with the views counter i 'm not trying to understand how it works in order to start gaming the system i only wish to learn how these things are done i hope stack exchange wo mind revealing some secrets update i 'm beginning to suspect this changing value at the end of the url is used to help aggregate the collected data by dividing time in still thinking in what way exactly update 2 so i 've tried my test project with different browsers to see if 204 no content would result in browser caching it does the counter url is retrieved again when the page is requested next time but the value at the end of the counter url is not changed i tried with internet explorer 8 and the current versions of firefox opera safari and chrome the behavior is identical and not surprising actually since the response for 204 does contain the expires header neither does a live response from so there is no reason for the browser to cache the response i kindly ask again the nice folks what is then the reason of that changing value of the counter url it does force temporary browser caching so the reason must be elsewhere

true	it should be possible to retag a question without bumping it to the front page while bumps are generally good there are niche cases where they are harmful i recently decided i would consolidate two tags on stack overflow openoffice and they refer to precisely the same thing and having two tags for them just fragments the organizational structure however after a couple of retags i noticed that these questions were being bumped to the front page clogging it up not wanting to be disruptive i stopped retagging this prevents a very useful organizational benefit of so 's community structure as well as consolidating two identical tags i could do things like look at each question in and add the tag openoffice-writer openoffice-calc where appropriate abuse would be unlikely due to the 500 reputation minimum for retagging questions update july 2012 i think this problem is much less bothersome now that tags can have aliases my original use-case was merging two tags which is somewhat solved by aliases	ignoring retagged old questions possible duplicates it should be possible to retag a question without bumping it to the front page too much retagging etiquette don stewart is currently going through a lot of old haskell questions and retagging them nothing wrong with that but they show up on the home page rather pointlessly should they be ignored especially as many of them have an accepted answer
true	give an incentive for finding duplicate questions at present if you see a question that may be a duplicate and has an easy answer you can post the answers or post a link to the duplicate question or the few hi-rep users can vote to close it as duplicate think of normal users here not the people that read meta it is better for stack overflow if a link to the duplicate is posted as a comment or the user votes to close the question as a duplicate however the user gets more rep if posts the easy answer quickly i 'm thinking of something along the lines of first person to post a comment that points to possible duplicate gets some rep if the question is closed as a duplicate and at least 2 of the other closers chose that same dupe question whenever someone votes to close as a duplicate a possible duplicate comment should be posted with a link to the other question if there is not already a link to it in a comments the system now does this as ether said the removal of reputation earned from answering a question that is later closed as a duplicate would at least remove the negative incentive but is that enough to correct this behaviour is a duplicate finder badge part of the solution a bronze badge for being the first person to vote to close a question as a duplicate with the same duplicate of question chosen as most closers choose a silver badge for doing the same 25 times see also strangedupe or how i learned to stop worrying and love duplication improve tools for closing as duplicate would also help	another kind of disciplined badge i often see a trivial question i can answer in about a minute but since it 's so easy it must have been asked before right so i 'm faced with a choice find the existing question and vote to close the new one as duplicate this would benefit the site driving all users with the same question to one place answer it immediately quite possibly collecting a couple of votes at the expense of adding to the clutter fragmentation on the site searching for duplicates is tedious and unrewarding i have to copy and paste the question or type it rephrased then read a couple of possible duplicates and maybe even repeat the search there may not even be a worthy existing question in short it 's far more rewarding to just answer this happens to me a lot and every time i have the distinct feeling that it really takes discipline to do the right thing and search first a badge would be nice for this those folks who do take the time and effort to find duplicates and get them closed deserve a reward ps as for the current meaning of the disciplined badge i hardly ever feel that i would exercise discipline by deleting my own upvoted answer on the other hand the urge to answer instead of searching happens to me pretty much every day and i 'm a pretty casual user far from a fanatic

true	how does a new user begin using stack exchange as a new user i find it impossible to contribute to the community or to even begin contributing i know why the reputation system is in place and i respect it but at the same time it is too hard on new users it started with me wanting to upvote a question vote up requires 15 reputation just to appreciate a good question that helped me i need 15 rep ok so i find out how i can get reputation points more or less i need to ask a question for and add an answer for i do have any questions at the moment and i do want to spam a random question but i did happen to have a slightly different answer to the earlier question that i wanted to upvote so i try to answer this question is protected to prevent thanks me too or spam answers by new users to answer it you must have earned at least 10 reputation on this site now i know this does apply to every question but at the same time this means i 'm forced to answer yet another question and i do want to go around looking for random questions and spam irrelevant answers now i 'm stuck so i try to talk to some other users in the chat rooms about how to go about getting reputation points and how they first started i entered into a casual chat room you must have 20 reputation on meta stack overflow to talk here yes i can understand why this is enforced because we do want new users to spam chat rooms but all i wanted to do was ask for help so i ca even talk to anyone about my newbie problems so okay i 'll just settle for upvoting comments in the question that helped me i do see an upvote hover-over button so i ca even do that so now i 'm stuck at 1 reputation point unable to cross that 15 rep barrier and even after posting this question i 'll only have 6 rep points and still unable to do anything and i 'll be forced to look for questions to answer yes i should be contributing to the community but i should need to begin answering or making questions to upvote questions and answers this only spurs more answers if anything very very very new-user unfriendly	the reputation model for voting i have been with stackoverflow since almost more than a year as a user i have always been willing to contribute to stackoverflow by voting for the best contributions at the very least the problem is i do have the need to code extensively so i really do have any unique questions all of them so far had been asked and since i am much of a beginner to coding world i really do have answers to any questions as they are of a good stature i am able to find answers to my questions very easily on so or google but if i do ask question and if i am not good enough to answer a question how ever will i be able to vote to vote you require 15 rep  and yes i have been helped by users extensively i have over 50 bookmarks saved over my browsers for really good questions and answers all i have is 1 rep on so i just ca vote what else can you do to improve your rep when you are starting off at 1 or at least should voting be given a privilege to all the beginners
true	closing etiquette why do some answer and close i 've noticed quite a few cases here 's a recent one where people not only vote to close a question but then also answer said question at best this is just silly and at worst it is totally hypocritical and seems almost like rep whoring since often the closers answers are the only ones that remain to be voted on since no new answers can be given if you want to close a question it makes more sense to simply add a comment if you feel the need to say something this also leaves the option open for the author of the question to delete it if they want to if the author realizes they 've asked a duplicate or they want to avoid the onslaught of downvotes that can often accompany a closed question they should be allowed to delete it however if any answers to the question have upvotes the author ca delete it so why do people answer and close should we try to crack down on this sort of thing via either new features clearly stating it in the faqs or just getting the word out through commenting when we see it edit just to clarify i 'm asking this in relation to so not metaso	if you vote to close a question you should be able to post an answer possible duplicate closing etiquette why do some answer and close and vice versa i do have anything more to say just remove that paradox

false	is excessive bounty hunting good etiquette i figured i 'd confront this question directly because it 's been on my mind since i started answering questions on so again as a recreation i 've been trying to increase my reputation on so by providing the most help i can professionally because i 'm admittedly a slower typist than many users on the site and because i wanted to leave most of the common questions to people whom enjoy answering them and are better answerers than i i started answering bounties at a clip of about two a day what i discovered to my surprise is this kicked me up to 1 reputation on the site for the current week so far and 42 for last week while i 'm absolutely flattered i do see myself as especially worthy of this position after all i 'm simply answering a smaller set of highly refined questions to the best of my abilities through experience and the aid of google and working with the original posters to solve their problems concisely and correctly so i am simply curious if i 'm doing it right or if i 've found some loophole that is competitively frowned upon i admit that i quite enjoy answering questions here and i 'd still answer bounties consistently because i find them to provide more interesting puzzles for me to solve but at the same time i believe the other contributors to the site in the 100k range should be ranking higher than some goof that answered a set of 200 300 and 500 rep bounties back to back i suppose it 's just a thing	should i re-phrase my question or make comments to answers when i wrote my question i assumed that the order of the data would be preserved but the answer i got resulted in the order changing i 've put some comments to the answer but i wondered if i should perhaps rephrase the question instead to make it clear that i want the order of the data to be preserved

false	how to phrase my subjective question to avoid unconstructive answers often i face myself asking a tricky question where someone interested in giving me a constructive answer would have to sit down and think they would also need to care about my question and my problem and be open-minded instead they often end up just trying to make a point the point they 've had all their lives and they wo reconsider or make me bad or show off their sometimes questionable knowledge in short useless and not constructive usually this does happen when the question itself is technical and can be answered very objectively but as soon as i 'd like a subjective critical but constructive answer i get a bashing and even more so the bashers get votes by other bashers such that the really constructive interesting answers will move down in ranking among all the answers is there a way to circumvent that in phrasing my question very carefully how any ideas welcome note downvoting or flagging them is maybe not the best option because they may still have a valid point but they did not answer constructively	posting with all lower case letters did allow me to submit my question i posted this question earlier typing the zip code does yield the company page while using my google tv as soon as i hit submit to submit my question i got an error with something to the effect of my post content was not of good quality i retread it over and over and tried to submit and it continued to error out i then realised because i was using my google tv i had ignored capitilizing for instance the first letter of my initial paragraph using that darn google keyboard was dinky so i avoided capitalising as soon as i fixed that first word just by making it a capital letter as well as the first word in my second paragraph it worked fine seemed a bit odd
true	list questions community wiki there are absolutely loads of payment gateways out there and i 'd like a comprehensive list of them there 's already a question asking for the best ones what is the best credit card processing service and another asking for ones suitable for a charity can anyone recommend a payment gateway for a charity website  would such a question be on topic and would it need to be cw the obvious way to do it is to have one cw answer and edit all other answers into it i do know whether the question itself should be cw or just the main answer	is it wrong to ask a question with many answers possible duplicate list questions community wiki i 'm referring to my question here java optimizations i do completely understand why it was closed it does not violate any of the reasons stated i am looking for concrete facts not opinion i do think this question would start a large the only possible reason i can find was stated in a comment by goran jovic anyway your problem was most likely closed because there is no finite answer to it it would probably spawn dozens of answers each containing a single optimization this is usually not considered constructive because it is very easy for initial format to degrade to a poll perhaps this may be true but is it necessarily bad i believe the answers to this question are legitimate and would be extremely this is evident in the comments again as two people learned something very useful without even a single direct answer i can sort of see why it was closed but was it really necessary i was honestly looking forward to the answers and thought others would enjoy learning something too
true	how to overcome edits must be at least 6 characters on stack overflow there was a question with an incorrectly formatted list which lacked a newline before it and thus came out like this 1 hello 2 something else 3 goodbye i changed it to the right formatting by inserting a newline hello something else goodbye and i got the edits must be at least 6 characters error message is there an ok way to trick this rule	why should an edit be of at least 6 characters i 'm doing my first reviews on stack overflow and sometimes just formatting need to be corrected i formatted a code snippet but the system does not allow me to save the changes because the edit needs to be of at least 6 characters so what should i do replace some words with synonyms to step over the 6 character limitation

true	auto-protect questions that get more than n answers from new users in a 24-hour period expanding the criteria for auto-protection has been discussed in the past should we automatically protect all questions with more than n answers but i think that discussion addresses the wrong problem protecting a question with a large number of answers does do anything to fix the problems caused by having a large number of answers in most cases the question should still be either cleaned up or closed large numbers of answers does not necessarily indicate a honeypot for misguided newbies while a fair number of these do fall into bikeshed territory that 's not universally true and blocking outsiders from answering a question just because a lot of insiders have already gotten to it does solve anything the occasional drive-by answer on an old answered question is that much of a problem and we have existing tools for identifying and handling them generally the existing criteria for auto-protect are sufficient for perpetually-popular posts however there is a scenario that is addressed by them a question that sees a sudden extreme increase in popularity and as a result attracts a large number of non-answers that must then be deleted the classic case is a post that rises to the top of reddit for a while although we 've seen similar effects from other sources and even generated internally from links on our own hot list or meta posts let me be clear these 15 minutes of fame are inherently bad a good question that attracts a lot of attention can also attract some really great answers but there 's always that temptation to just participate even when you 've nothing of value to contribute and moderating a sudden influx of such answers can be troublesome particularly on smaller sites if no moderator is around it falls on trusted members of the community to remove non-answers we 're working on distributing the load here but this will still be labor-intensive on smaller sites when your first experience on a site is having your post deleted it does exactly endear you to the community there yes you may well have learned a valuable lesson from it but we could be a bit more gentle about teaching that the communities on these sites knowing full-well how troublesome such answers can be may try to proactively protect questions that start to garner a lot of attention potentially locking out good answers on questions that would actually be problematic if left to themselves that last one in particular concerns me i think most users use their privilege responsibly but the notion that hot questions need preemptive protection has proved stronger than common sense here and i do think we should fight it instead let 's expand the existing heuristics to protect questions that are demonstrating problematic tendencies but have yet been proven problematic as explained in the title this means protecting questions that 've gotten more than n answers deleted or otherwise in a 24-hour period from users who 've earned less than 10 reputation on the site excluding any association bonuses this would be a check made when the answer is posted so if n is 3 the third answer from a new user would block further answers on most sites n can be fairly large a threshold of 5 would protect questions like these on stack overflow should i use jmonkeyengine 3 jme 3 or unity to teach game programming to my children on certain sites we might want to set the threshold significantly lower a threshold of 4 would protect questions like these on the workplace what can i do to quickly adapt to a new role which appears to require knowledge that i do yet have what is a friendly way to let managers know that having good developers is a privilege dad jokingly told boss that i called him dumb to my shock how can i respond to why should we hire you solo developer at a startup how do i stay awake during work without the use of coffee project manager asks for complete 100 confidence everytime committing code coupled with this change i think it also makes sense to expand the existing protect privilege to allow users to unprotect questions that were automatically protected thus allowing them to override the system if it becomes overzealous related should trending questions be auto-protected can we do something more useful when new users land on a protected question automatically protect questions with three or more deleted answers	should trending questions be auto-protected i noticed today that a request for protection came up due to the the large number of me-too answers on a trending question i answered recently this got me thinking since trending questions get far more attention than the average question should questions that trend be automatically protected on the upside this does seem to be a common problem and the auto-protection could be put in place only while the question is trending on the downside it would make it more difficult for new people to participate in answering a trending highly visible question so it could be a barrier to entry thoughts

true	build and strengthen the stack exchange community with crossover questions between sites i 've been a stack exchange contributor for a couple of years now currently most active on one thing that keeps coming up is questions that would appeal to audiences on two different stack exchange sites but there are almost no features taking advantage of these questions on we have crossover questions most often with and possibly next most often with but it can happen with almost any se site today alone we had a question that would cross over with and had a question that would cross over with us i am absolutely sure that this must happen all the time between arbitrary pairs of stack exchange sites but the only feature that takes advantage of it is the possibility of migrating off-topic questions which leaves the original question acting as a redirect across the two sites i think there is a missed opportunity to build the network between sites where users of one site do realize they could make valuable contributions to a sister site they have had so far little to do with at the very least there could be a way to advertise a question on a second site that could be interested in it probably by listing it in the sidebar where there are also links to meta questions linked questions related questions new blog posts and but there could also be some kind of features that make some sort of acceptable crossposting there could be added around building cross-site questions or whatever else you can think up i think this is a great way for people to spread their expertise from their main site onto other sites to make the network stronger and more cohesive to bring more attention to questions that would have a divided audience between two sites i can think only of positives and no negatives does anyone else have some ideas to add or think this is a bad idea for any reason example crossover questions here are some links to some crossover questions i 've been finding in the stack exchange network here this was previously posted as an answer but more people wanted it to be part of the question stream airfare data is it possible to cook pasta at room temperature with low enough pressure is our mental lexicon structured like a tag-cloud system or hierarchical in latent semantic analysis how do you recombine the decomposed matrices after truncating the singular values if travelling through excessively cold regions what steps should you take to keep your vehicle warm enough to drive what is usually an american breakfast outside of the us how do bicycle spokes work where is a tripod allowed from high up in new york city twitter image encoding challenge if the letter j is only 400 500 years old was there a j sound that preceded the design of the letter british sunni muslim visiting iran with family why does stack exchange require you to click to be turned down	link questions between sites what can i do to decrease load times of html pages this question would be well-suited to both so and webmasters maybe better suited just to webmasters but there is enough traffic about reducing html load latency on so that i would like an excellent question answer here that can help stave off duplicates i think it 'd be super if there was some way to symlink hardlink this question and answer between the two sites it would bring a larger audience to bear on editing it and it would have only a single copy to maintain for those who would like it to be in sync on both so is there any mechanism for symlinking hardlinking linking questions on multiple se sites if not is there enough reason to build one thanks
false	fix the inconsistency in revision numbering it appears that revisions are indexed starting both at 0 and 1 related sometimes they just do make sense at all for example this question says 9 revs 8 users but in the revision history the most recent revision is numbered 10 not 9 that 10th revision is also a reversion to revision 8 the summary is automatically generated the original post was not a revision of itself obviously so 0-indexing and 9 revisions makes sense but it was the first version so 1-indexing and 10 versions makes sense as well but i think we should have something consistent so we all know what we 're talking about solution 1 have the revisions page start the numbering at 0 or have the original post marked op and the revisions to it start as 1 the auto-generated text on a reversion would follow suit this is my preferred solution since it makes the numbers consistent between versions and revisions solution 2 change the text on the posts from x revs to ver y the example question would then show ver 10 8 users rather than 9 revs 8 users i prefer revs though and hence prefer the first proposal	asking days badges a couple of months ago i suggested a set of badges for asking questions the responses were mixed the top answer can be summarized in practice all this would do is encourage people to ask yet more stupid worthless questions and we have quite enough of that as it is we believe that one of the main things holding back many of our beta sites is that when people have questions they are in the habit of asking on the site even our flagship site stack overflow does get many questions from its most knowledgeable users perhaps they do have questions but far more likely they find answers without needing to ask our subtle bias against asking questions clueless means we lose out on what might be our best source of excellent questions so we went back to the drawing board and designed a badge set that should not encourage worthless questions asked a well-received question on x separate days and maintained a positive question record in order to award badges we need to define our terms positive question record total questions negative questions closed deleted total questions it triple counts a question that is downvoted closed and deleted if you ask one that hits that trifecta you 'll need to ask three better questions to dig yourself out my own record of asking does not meet the criteria 44 0 12 12 44 my public record looks a lot better i had a bunch of questions from the beta period that have been subsequently and rightfully deleted with care i could bring my record into positive territory with 4 questions the takeaway is that people ca sweep past indiscretions under the rug by deleting them and they can recover from a bad start as long as they do ask more bad questions well-received question on x separate days a well-received question is one that 's open not deleted and has a score 0 if you ask at least one well-recieved question in a utc day and none of your questions that day are deleted downvoted or closed you get one more day of credit toward the badge whenever the badge criteria is checked previous asking days are re-evaluated so that there 's an incentive to fix downvoted closed questions the criteria is to prevent people from asking several questions at once and deleting any that are upvoted or answered to ask another day though this is a losing strategy in the long run my proposed badge names and levels asked a well-received question on 5 separate days and maintained a positive question record asked a well-received question on 30 separate days and maintained a positive question record asked a well-received question on 100 separate days and maintained a positive question record in addition since some outstanding individuals ask on more than 100 days the gold badge may be awarded multiple times over on english oishi-sama now a community moderator would have a remarkable 5 socratic badges bronze and silver badges are only awarded once we 've decided to hold off on multiple awards for now see the announcement on mso neither the names nor the levels nor even the descriptions are set in stone please play around with this query to get an idea of how the badge works using our public data since the query does not account for deleted questions it 's a bit more generous than the actual badges would be this version of the badge set should encourage a habit of well-received questions over time and encourage people to fix poorly received questions i 'd like to express my gratitude to the parenting community for participating in our experiments
true	encouraging users to create an account and keep it i know so 's policy is you do have to register to ask questions but there are so many new members and so many the majority of the questions i see now are coming from new users it 's their first question although unregistered users should still be able to ask questions i think we should encourage users to create an account here is a couple of ways we could do that explicitly encourage people to get an account there 's currently nothing telling people to do that maybe tell people something like get an account it 's easy and maybe show some of the perks of having an account and having rep maybe give a few bonus points for registering and have that enable a basic privilege it could be taken from one of the new user restrictions for example of course getting people to register is just half of the battle i do know what the stats are on this but i think there 's a number of users who create multiple accounts anyways we could curb that by having smart er duplicate account detection systems alerting someone who is about to create a new account and possibly has an account already give them a message like hey it looks like you already have this account are you sure you want to create a new one create a new privilege 10k 20k that gives users tools to detect possible duplicate accounts eg list users with the same e-mail list users with the same ip addresses without revealing said emails and ips then the can look at other stuff posts and refer the new user to a moderator for a possible merge	why are there so many users with low reputation points i see that many of the questions posted all have really low reputations points from 1-50 given that you get points for simply editing and selecting answers i find this hard to believe it makes me less likely to want to answer questions as it seems these users create accounts just to mine information and then open up another account for their next question why not give users more incentives to use the site as an actual user and not just a place to mine information for example the ability to delete down-voted posts the ability to block users trolls basically any of the things popular social sites have

false	what questions belong on super user vs server fault i see a lot of desktop admin questions being migrated to super user are we positing that enterprise desktop support belongs on super user to me it 's just as valuable for server fault to have information on things like troubleshooting a bsod on windows xp on server fault because the troubleshooting steps for a desktop bsod and a server bsod are the same to me super user was put out as the version of server fault	how can se sites use personal information like e-mail addresses i submitted a question to in february 2010 in the last month i 've received two unsolicited emails from them it seems they are abandoning the aspect of their site and they are trying to advertise their new service i 'm not going to complain too much about two e-mails but it did make me wonder if all these newfangled stack exchange sites i 'm registering for are going to start spamming me does stack exchange place any restrictions on the way its participating sites can use personal information like e-mail addresses edit i 'm referring to not claims that is an old se site says it is in my mind that does change my question or concern my expectation as a user is that since stack overflow does spam me with e-mails that do pertain to my own activity on the site other sites that use se technology or partnership or however that relationship is defined wo do it either
true	lists comparing two constructive or not related why is a feature comparison list question not considered constructive so i recently asked the question it was thereafter shortly closed because it was a list question i was first pointed to the general stance on shopping questions ie list of ways to do something are list questions off topic then i was pointed to the blog post for gorilla versus shark which outlined why general x vs y which is better is not constructive however i feel that my question and questions in general do not quite fit into these established stances arguments every answer is equally valid generally those questions are infinite as a new answer could always be added they also tend to be subjective it 's which is the most accurate is correct it 's possibly a bit subjective but with the context my question included for generating code i do think this is a problem a new answer could not always be added though a comprehensive list would rarely become complete it 's not always becoming out of date with the exception of new software releases nobody needs to know the answer to this question do you own a gorilla do you own a shark when was the last time you even saw a gorilla and shark going at it hand to fin in other words what is your skin in this particular game what specific problem other than idle curiosity would answering this question satisfy or solve for you or anyone else people in the planning stages of code generation projects would like to know the answer to this question some of the pros might overlap especially well with what they are doing etc it 's not nearly specific enough where will the fight be in what location underwater or on land what are the rules of the fight so we can determine a victor will it be to the death or under some type of points system can they be trained specifically to fight by trainers or are they completely on their own without any kind of scope every answer can make any assumptions they like and there will assuredly be hundreds all different i covered where the fight will be in the code generation arena this is fairly specific context i think it is difficult to learn from these questions let 's say hypothetically speaking we had a site full of people who have hands-on experience with both gorillas and sharks and they were hypothetically speaking willing to answer such a question to the best of their expert knowledge in the process you might learn a few interesting things about both animals such as that an adult gorilla 's upper body strength is six times more powerful than that of an adult human or that shark skin is so tough and hard that before the invention of sandpaper shark skin was used to polish wood but this sort of learning is largely accidental at best like a random walk through an encyclopedia it might be entertaining as a speculative diversion to compare and contrast these two very different animals in broad terms but even under ideal circumstances there really can be no absolute answer to this question other than it depends both animals are adapted to their particular environment and have certain strengths and weaknesses this is a good answer maybe even the correct answer but it 's just not that useful i 'm not sure about this part this question is basically asking in this area what are both animals strengths and weaknesses i do think this applies but ca come up with a good argument otherwise it drives away experts what serious expert animal trainer would give gorilla shark the time of day this kind of question attracts the opposite of experts people who are serious animal trainers but are willing to engage in idle speculation and discussiony generalities rather than focusing on the real world specific questions they face in their day to day work any true expert who came to would be appalled to see a question like gorilla shark appear on the homepage i would think it drives away experts if an expert in t4 i 'd like to consider myself that did know anything about roslyn this would be an interesting question to come across to figure out if they should be learning it to see what it can do since it applies to their specific task code generation so in summary what is the general stance are constructive  or not i tend to think their constructive but i 'd like to get a more official view point concensus so i know not to ask such questions also for reference do a search of pros cons on stackoverflow you 'll see a lot for the more recent questions some are closed and some are open hence me asking this question appropriate or not	why is a feature comparison list question not considered constructive why is it not considered appropriate to ask for the comparison between two specific software that are supposed to do the same thing personally i generally seek out comparison articles on software and hardware lawn mowers kitchen appliances before deciding which to buy on stackoverflow i asked about the comparison between visualgdb and wingdb i looked over much of the web related to these plugins but was unable to find any real feature comparison article or blog i felt that such information would be valuable and would have been a good fit for stackoverflow as i have used similar comparison type articles in the past

true	how far can i refactor the code in someone else 's question with a growing number of more or less inexperienced programmers on stack overflow it is frequent to see the questions containing code not only badly formatted but also badly written while editing a question to fix the formatting is okay i 'm wondering if it is correct when editing a question to bring small changes to the code to make it more readable in other words until when is it acceptable to do a modification of a piece of code in a question example let 's say there is a question with following crappy source code void dostuff string filename string msgtodisplay stream stfile new filestream filename if 0 boolean result stfile if result true msgtodisplay your file was submitted else msgtodisplay the file is invalid return msgtodisplay state 1 the first thing to do is a general cleanup just to make it readable void dostuff string filename string msgtodisplay stream stfile new filestream filename if 0 boolean result stfile if result true msgtodisplay your file was submitted else msgtodisplay the file is invalid return msgtodisplay state 2 the next thing may be to make some changes according to the style guidelines for and other minor changes which does not affect the code proper case bool instead of boolean the original author can still recognize her own code and if she understands well the code she 's written she will understand the new one private string dostuff string filename string messagetodisplay stream stream new filestream filename if 0 bool result stfile if result messagetodisplay your file was submitted else messagetodisplay the file is invalid return messagetodisplay state 3 the last thing to do make the more substantial changes by bringing things the original author may not know if she 's a beginner private string dostuff string filename string messagetodisplay bool isfilevalid null using stream stream new filestream filename if 0 isfilevalid stfile if messagetodisplay your file was submitted the file is invalid return messagetodisplay my thoughts until now i thought it may be a good idea to go until the state 2 but never do the state 3 if we do the first two states it leverages the quality of the content of stack overflow in general and shows that this is not a sort of website where you can post questions without bothering to format them correctly when other beginners are reading well-formatted code they will probably try to write well-formatted code outside stack overflow too the original author will see that her code was reformatted and maybe make an effort later to format the code by her own she can also wonder herself why string was transformed into string why there is a if result instead of if result true etc i had a lot of pain to go to the state 3 because it changes code so much that the original author may not understand why her own code was replaced by some stuff she does even understand the modified code may be quoted in the answers when the original author will try to link the answers to her own original piece of code she may not understand an answer and will blame the answerer instead of me or the person who modified the question there is a risk of changing the original algorithm just by mistake on the other hand i see a lot of answers which start by enumerating the incorrect parts of the source code forgotten usings on idisposable objects possible sql injection i do think those things have their place in the answers again keeping questions containing code with sql injection and without appropriate usings reduce the quality of stack overflow content it is especially important since many beginners copy-paste code from stack overflow without understanding it nor reading the whole page with all the answers and comments	should defects in answers be corrected by editing the answer or by leaving a comment possible duplicate how far can i refactor someone else 's code if an answer is good and apparently correct but contains an obvious defect like a coding error in an sql response should the error be corrected directly or should one leave a comment mentioning the problem my inclination would be to leave a comment if the answer is very recent and just edit the question if it was old i 'm just curious as to the proper protocol

true	do i have to worry about copyright issues for code posted on stack overflow i was wondering about the copyright of code snippets from answers let 's say you ask a question and the solution consists of ten lines of code which are given in an answer are there any restrictions about the use of that code it seems that the content of this page is under the creative commons license so does one have to attribute the author if code is used in an open source project can it be legally used in closed source projects at all i guess ten lines of code are not really problematic but is there a critical number of lines return to faq index	is it okay to use code from users answers let 's say i have this python code it has an issue so i 'm going to ask about it on stackoverflow print hello syntaxerror eol while scanning string literal them user comes along with the code for the solution to the issue print hello then let 's say this code is part of a big project i 've been working on this project will eventually be published is it okay to use the code from the user who answered your question
true	automatic removal of bracketed tags from question titles i have noticed a trend recently of people inserting tags into the title of their posts i have edited quite a few to remove those tags and it occurs to me that it would be a very simple operation to just remove them with a regex when they submit the question so instead of having a post title like this here is my question about how to create an object we just end up with this here is my question about how to create an object and we could possibly take this one step further and add the removed tag to the post as a proper tag if it is already present	can we remove tag names in question title possible duplicate automatic removal of bracketed tags from question titles as i see many questions will be posted with tagnames even though question already tagged with particular  why we cant remove those taganme from the question title for eg how to add user control on run time in can be replaced with how to add user control on run time may be it will help so that editing will be less
false	does giving an update to a 's status constitute a change in the meaning of the original post in this suggested edit i noted that the sigar library is now licensed under apache v2 and not gpl as is currently mentioned by the answer normally i would leave a comment in the answer hoping that the user who posted the answer might edit in the update but in this case that user has logged in to se for 4 years did the way i posted the suggestion actually change anything in the meaning of the original post if so what is the best way to post such an update	ability to add tag on so that seems like a plural but is i wanted to add a tag presenters but i ca because presenter already exists to explain this is not about a person doing a presentation it is presenters are used when coding within ruby on rails where you use presenters as objects to encapsulate a bunch of functionality they are actually called and referred to as presenters
false	flagging an answer hides all the answers i flagged a non an answer on this question but now i ca none of the answers including mine there is not much to say or adding print-screens i see only the question and it 's comments update well just for the fun i added the print screen maybe it will be helpful for the devs update 2 very weird now the flag was accepted and the not an answer answer was removed and now i can see the other answers	a flag towards an answer was declined but the reason given seems to conflict with the flagging option description i flagged an answer with the option very low quality according to this option description this answer has severe formatting or content problems as far as i understand the word content here means the technical side of the answer the actual information given in the answer and if it 's technically incorrect then the answer has severe content problems but i 've got a flag declined with the reason flags should not be used to indicate technical inaccuracies or an altogether wrong answer this reason seems to conflict with the very low quality option description i 'm not going to argue with this decision i just want to understand the policy behind it in order to flag properly in future question when is the question considered to have severe content problems
false	spurious character in favorite tags it looks like the fix implemented for this question breaks opera in favor of chrome that may be a reasonable tradeoff since i 'm guessing more folks are browsing in chrome but is there a stronger way to solve the problem that renders correctly in all browsers as noted here system fonts do always support the zero-width space character edit it 's probably related to this question	link with underscore does not work underscore in url gets escaped to 5f and does not work i 'm trying to use an underscore in a link in my answers at stackoverlow however the link does not work in the resulting html this is similar to the discussion here but the answers does work for me specifically i use the provided editor to create the link which should work according this answer is there a way to avoid the escaping the link works in internet explorer but not in firefox so it might be a firefox bug but strangely the link works with firefox from the editors preview
true	am i downvoting too much or are things really that bad let me say first that i am fairly new here about 3 weeks and absolutely love stack overflow at first i let some of the negative attitudes get to me a little left a few snarky comments but that phase has passed i see the tremendous value for this site in the long run and sincerely do want to help make it a better place i find myself going for the downvote very frequently currently about 35 of my votes are downvotes i even make an extra effort to upvote good content to offset this a bit so the number should probably be more like 60 i always try to leave constructive comments and try to help out the confused ones who are really trying i truly ca tell if it is just me or if these folks deserve it i do know if you guys noticed but there are a lot of really bad questions being posted and a lot of people trying to pass off things like use jquery use firebug and use google as good answers and getting upvotes  i even saw someone my what does firebug say comment as an answer and get 3 votes within moments sometimes this answer is unclear or not useful just does do it justice i feel like some of the people just drive me nuts but then again i feel this way irl am i being too harsh or is it really that bad on so has there recently been a surge of new users and the quality of content is degrading or was it like this in the good old days have i perhaps misunderstood the expected behavior on stack overflow should i just ignore these crappy questions and answers rather than downvote them	what kind of threshold should i have between up-voting down-voting and not-voting i decided to take a look at my profile on so and i get the impression that i 'm doing it wrong with regard to votes i feel like if i have answers total votes seems like a lousy amount to have now while i do have a few more upvotes than downvotes i tend to find myself looking at the vote buttons and either going this is a crap question downvote it or eh it 's a decent question but is it upvote-worthy i feel like i 'm being overly conservative with my votes is there any way to find out how my voting compares to that of users in general and what if anything should i change about my voting attitude to improve
true	is allowing voting and accepting answers on closed questions best practice i have noticed more and more on both su and mso users being able to vote on answers and questions that has been closed as well as being able to accept answers my feeling on this is that this degrades the value of a closed question since the op simply ignores the fact that it is closed and still accepts and answers and users still gain reputation for answers on closed questions i tend to find this more commonly happening with new users my question is this behavior correct should it be changed	should votes count after a question has been closed possible duplicate is allowing voting and accepting answers on closed questions best practice i 'm curious what people think about being able to vote on a question that has been closed should it be allowed or once a question is closed should all voting cease case in point when 's the best day and best time to post a question to question closed and some tool i wo mention names makes a comment after its been closed i retort in jest and apparently i hurt her feelings and as a retaliation she down-votes my answer so what do you think should voting continue on closed questions

true	let questions stay open for a minimum amount of time before being closed feature request make questions unclosable until one hour after they 've been asked with an exception for flagged questions question what reason can you give for a non-abusive but otherwise bad question being closed as soon as possible bonus points for explaining the rationale behind your answer rebuttal since closed questions can still show up on various lists the implication is that deletion is the goal of closing a question since a question ca be deleted for two days see shog9 's comment in this answer why the fuss about delaying the closing of a question for a relatively small number of minutes the notion that the ratio on the home page outweighs all other considerations assumes that most people answer questions mainly from there i almost never use the home page preferring the newest or active tabs or using a tag seeing as the number of closed questions is so low i 'd hesitate to call them pollution i would guess that less then 10 of any of the regular lists consists of closed questions also it seems that it is much easier to close a question than to reopen one if you disagree i invite you to put your reasons in an answer or a comment before doing so with a downvote related question reputation penalty for closing a question that gets reopened	questions getting closed too fast within hours give it some time to live possible duplicate let questions stay open for a minimum amount of time before being closed this is has happened to me a few times and it 's getting annoying i post a question sometimes for discussion and within hours it gets closed before i have the chance to read the answers or comments or make things clearer if some people think it 's a duplicate i want to go no  no it 's close to some other question but it 's not a real duplicate  let me clarify it seems there are some people are just too click happy to downvote or close questions some of us do not live in so and we do check in every 10 minutes the whole day so give me a chance to answer questions or make things clearer before executing the victim proposal force a question to stay open for some period of time before it gets closed i had issues with the re-open option the other issue is that once a question is closed those people who left comments or answers are gone
false	email subscription to a combination of tags using and operator lately i 've noticed that hovering over tags opens a mini info-window with tag related data and activities including email subscription option great but instead of subscribing to just a single tag i 'd rather subscribe to a combination tagx and tagy and tagz giving me a much better selection of questions delivered to my email inbox similar to viewing questions with a particular tag you can always click on any of the related tags and you get a subset of questions that have both tags the first one and the second one as well and not either is this kind of email subscription possible or are there any plans on developing it edit tag sets on stackexchange as suggested by do work because they are combined by an or operator instead of an and a tag set therefore widens the filter instead of narrowing it just so you know this question has been sufficiently answered yet	should css vendor prefixes be used in answers i 'm wondering if there 's a guideline for answering css questions in regards to prefixing properties and values with vendor prefixes i realize that vendor prefixes become unnecessary over time and in fact become deprecated and dropped after a long period of time as is the case with some moz properties but i 'm referring to answers to questions at the time when the answer is posted i 've been seeing answers with and without prefixes and some with prefixes that have already been unprefixed for a while border-box not necessary since chrome 9 border-box still necessary box-sizing border-box and then there 's people who blindly prefix everything for trident some values just work in ie 10 and using a prefixed value or property will not bring backwards compatibility to ie 9 for instance there is no occasionally i still see border-radius being prefixed with webkit and moz even though the standard property has been supported since chrome 4 and firefox 4 and firefox 13 will throw a warning upon seeing the moz prefix i think we can all agree that the khtml prefix is obselete as it is supported only by safari 2 and konqueror for properties that existed in test at that time i assume luckily i do see any answers with that worst of all is the o prefix which still comes up rather frequently of course none of this applies if the question targets a specific version of a browser what 's the community 's take on this

true	can we have a feature to delay a flag for a short period of time as a moderator sometimes it 's nice to defer a flag but not have it in the mod-queue there are various reasons but the simplest is that if the 1 count is static you kinda gloss over it but if it disappears today and reappears tomorrow we 're not going to gloss over it as often this is particularly useful when true resolution of the flag depends on actions from other users you sometimes need to give people time to act on a comment the moderator left before truly resolving the situation so can we have a way to delay a flag for n hours new edits given the following flag types not an answer naa can be postponed additional similar flags revoke postponement low quality lq can be postponed edits revoke postponement it does belong here idbh either it 's game for migration or it 's not same goes for ot if it 's meh put it on meta and dismiss the flag until concensus is reached via discussion at which point you already have a link to it spam if the mod ca do something right then then they should dismiss and annotate comments rude or offensive ro rude is usually pretty well understood decide or perish not constructive off-topic ot obsolete too chatty same as ro other the only possible postponable one for those that do postpone for those flags that do get postponed we should set a limit on postponement since the easiest way is to see if the flag already has a previous postponement trying to postpone a second time seems like the easiest check and sounds like a good starting point and if we go that route maybe instead of a dismissal we can have a button to insert a canned response i wo honor the flag for naa lq until someone from the community tries to make this post better or something but the dismissal should still count as a dismissal negative flag weight score canned responses often suck but we do need a lot of commentary here just mostly no you fix it first then ask me to fix it also consider including a link to the moderators are human exception handlers not the only fixit men on the site shog9 offers hey folks someone flagged this q as offensive to all senses but strictly-speaking i ca taste the rot yet maybe you spend 5 minutes and clean this up before the next guy flags and i do delete it with prejudice	can we have a snooze alarm for flags when handling flags sometimes i see one for say comments that will be obsolete but are yet or a post that 's currently low-quality but i want to give the new otherwise-promising user a little time to fix it before nuking it what happens now is that i just skip past that flag and it continues to hang out in the flag list cluttering the view and i may have to skip past it a few times before i stop and ask myself is it time yet  or sometimes i do look i see that the flag count has changed so i think the queue is down to the ones we 're waiting on but what i did notice is that someone else handled one of them and meanwhile a new flag came in that i ought to look at in cases like this i 'd like to be able to defer the flag to hit a virtual snooze button while in this state the flag disappears from the flag list perhaps there 's a link to get pending ones so it 's still findable and then it comes back just like a new flag at the appointed time i do think we need to be able to vary the snooze time that might be nice but a simple ask again tomorrow would do the trick on the smaller sites where i see flags so might need a different value 1 this may seem silly on large established sites with tons of users coming through but on smaller betas there can be more of a call to nurture new users

true	retag symfony-2 to symfony2 symfony-2 is semantically wrong as it refers to actual application minor version rather than major symfony2 vs symfony1 meaning that semantically questions related to version which is officially in beta as of today will be tagged wrongly and we already have a tag synonym that suits better symfony2 which we should use so in short my proposal is to switch tag priority between symfony-2 and symfony2 make symfony2 the main tag and symfony-2 a synonym of it	tag chaos symfony and version numbers possible duplicate retag symfony-2 to symfony2 right now there is a bit of a chaos if one has a look at the symfony tags symfony there is the tag symfony which is most used right now 4198 questions it holds no information about the major version which is very bad as version 1 and 2 are essentially different frameworks with almost nothing in common well they both use yaml files and swiftmailer but thats about it the description on the tag is clearly written with symfony 1 in mind people are using it for both versions which makes this tag useless when filtering for specific information symfony-1 symfony-1 the tags symfony-1 4 questions and symfony1 1326 all refer to the same major version their might be some specifics which changed but overall it 's the code base merging this tags into a symfony1 tag would be benefitial for everyone looking for information on symfony 1 symfony-2 symfony-2 same situation their might be some specifics which will change between and which is beta right now but overall most questions asked with symfony in mind 3891 are valid for 10 questions so far how to solve this dilemma from my point of view there are some ways to solve this deprecating the symfony adding a symfony1 and having all minor version tags be a synonym for the major version tag using the symfony for version 1 and the symfony2 tag for version 2 again making minor versions synonyms at least i would vote to somehow prevent people from using the generic symfony working with symfony everyday it 's annoying to have no tag to rely on symfony is way to generic and one ends up with half the questions about the wrong framework maybe more experienced people can contribute their knowledge on how such situations where solved in the past i think solving this tag problem would make stackoverflow to a more valuable source of answers for symfony developers

true	building an archive of deleted questions back when the first discussion about deleted questions came up i promised to look into building an official unofficial read-only archive for good deleted se content i had a plan to build something like this each link would point to a scraped stackoverflow or other se network deleted question of course with a big fat disclaimer to the top historical data legal stuff yada yada yada and of course after asking stack exchange for permission seeing as this would go far beyond what the cc license allows i also registered a domain name that would imo suit nicely however when thinking about it i realized doing this properly is a lot of work you would have to build a scraper that can use a 10k er 's openid to fetch the deleted question using the api or the data dump is for wusses if we go through all this trouble we want a historical document of what the site looked like back then right edit the page 's dom to remove dynamic elements remove the deleted css classes remove all the voting abilities from the buttons and add the this is historical data disclaimer fetch this is the biggest part and applies even if you use the api or data dump all linked image resources even those from imgur even images used only in deleted questions could be purged one day store them and link them fetch all associated css style sheets and store them intelligently preferably in a way that you do fetch a copy of each file for each page as normal page scrapers do but also in a way that does break if se update their style sheets long story short i wo be in a position to build this any time in the foreseeable future with old work new work and studying i really have enough on my plate already of course if somebody else in the community feels like giving this a try cool but what i was really thinking is maybe this is something stack exchange should build after all i know jeff 's official stance on these questions is used to be i did think about a sweet place for them in the bitbucket jeff atwood dec 29 '10 at but come on think about it future deletion discussions and changes in on-topicness policy would become way more relaxed because the popular and loved stuff has a place to go a site for overflown questions could be curated by selected community members who decide whether a contribution deserves to be archived or not a separate domain name i 'm happy to donate for the purpose if desired and the separate site design would create enough distance to the stack exchange network it would be crystal clear that this read-only archive is for historical purposes only and the existence of a question there does not mean you can ask something similar on one of the live sites the pages would be scrapes of what the site looked like at the time of the scraping making it a general historical archive as well these questions traditionally drive a lot of traffic the possibility of continuing to show ads in the usual places would allow stack exchange to take advantage of that traffic without endangering content quality on the se network hosting an archive like this is a job for a business not us regular joes a private project hosted by some community member can go down once they forget to pay a bill or decide they want to password protect their private blog or photo album the ideal place to host a site like this is at a company with professional admins that intends to stay online for a long time how about it	archive with deleted questions for users with less than 10k rep possible duplicate building an archive of deleted questions as someone who is trying to learn how to master emacs i found the question the single most useful emacs feature a great source of information before it was deleted i noticed that this question is listed under the popular deleted questions list i think i have read here in meta that the team may be working on building a static archive of these questions potentially freezing them with a locking mechanism with this my questions are is there a reason why the emacs question was not added to the popular deleted questions list has there been any progress on setting up an archive of snapshots of deleted questions is there any way a user with less than 10k could retrieve the contents of a question like the one i mentioned

false	remove generally applicable part of too localized rationale for closing questions update 2 it seems that there is still confusion regarding the issue so this is as plainly and clearly as i can state it closing a question ie a request for help with resolving a problem solely on the grounds that it does not also benefit some arbitrary idea of what is sufficiently copious people other than the asker is indecorous and should be removed as part of the too localized rationale yes that is plain and clear update i need to make a clarification the too localized tag currently reads as follows too localized this question would only be relevant to a small geographic area a specific moment in time or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet the problem i am describing is due to the fact that it encompasses too many unrelated issues sure time-sensitive questions eg ones that expire or do make sense after some point would make sense to be closed though it does not mean that they should no longer be answered anyway if they can eg how many people downloaded the beta version of foobar or how much memory did that obsolete no-longer produced system have or how did people work around with this compiler bug that most people no longer have to worry about because they have bought the latest version but some of us can not afford and still have to deal with the geographic area part makes no sense what exactly constitutes small who decides what happens if those decision-makers move to a small town will they change their minds since it now affects them here 's a question that could appear on serverfault that highlights this issue has anyone managed to configure ipv6 with their local isp here connection possibly hypothetical but still valid and pertinent or another one that could appear on superuser how many others in state are finding that acme netbooks are shipping with pirated copies of the os  this may not apply in north america but in a lot of other countries it is a valid question that could easily comes up how about this question that could appear on stackoverflow i 'm still waiting for my copy of acme that i bought online i 've heard europeans have gotten theirs has anyone in canada granted the of this one is questionable-ish what exactly is too small what does it matter anyway the not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet sic part is exceptionally inappropriate as i demonstrate below it should not matter why would it matter if someone 's problem does not apply to everybody else in the world they are here to ask for help how would you like it if you went to the doctor only to have him turn you away because your disease is too rare and finding a cure for it would not sufficiently benefit the world at large you went there for help i suggest the removal of the affects too few people reason for closing questions if someone wants help then either help them if you can move along and ignore the question if you ca or else clearly and flat out tell them that you wo answer their question because there 's nothing in it for you or others do hide behind the esoteric sounding too localized tag original i 've seen lots of issues raised with the too localized reason for closing a question personally i think one part of it in particular is absurd and frankly kind of offensive i put forth here two arguments for its removal one moral and one logical one of the too many unrelated parts encompassed in the too localized reason for closing a question is that a question is not of interest to enough people not necessarily no others than the asker but rather not enough whatever that means this makes no sense because the purpose of these stackexchange sites is so that people can get help to solve their problems not a place where generic technology information can be found though that is a logical extension of the main purpose that 's what reference sites manuals wikis are for therefore it seems quite insulting that a person who has a problem with something comes here and asks for help only to be turned away because their problem is not amusing or applicable enough to lots of others it is offensive that people would only help someone if there is something in it for themselves or others rather than help that person in need another problem with that part of the too localized tag is that the stackexchange sites have clearly identified their purpose as being a place where people can come and ask definite singularly answerable questions and try to eschew discussion questions this is not a forum this is not a forum if someone has a problem with something relatively unique to their situation it is all the more answerable however if they must find a way to generalize the problem so that it applies to lots of others then it becomes less answerable and more of a discussion question take for example questions of the forms should i how can i  an asker would describe their circumstances and ask if or how to do or accomplish a task under that scenario this is usually a pretty easy question to definitively answer however generalizing the question to should one under each of the following circumstances or how to in each of these configurations becomes much more of a discussion question i hope i have laid out sufficient evidence that the the general applicability part of the too localized reason for closing a question has no place on these sites though it may have in some sorts of se type sites i no longer welcome counter-arguments and examples of why it actually would be but i for one still can not fathom a rational reason to keep it okay i do welcome them if they really are reasonable and fitting	posting a

true	upvoting based on celebrity too many upvotes excessive rep slurping i have noticed a couple of kinds of behavior that seem to crop up in the so community and it really seems to artificially boost reputation there may not be a solution or it may not be a problem but here are some thoughts the first is the fact that celebrity users or users with lots of reputation are treated significantly better than others take joel spolsky 's most recent question how do you move the turtle in logo it was closed opened closed and re-opened and the question has earned joel what 1030 reputation 103 votes and lots of reputation wow i 'm not saying that joel 's question is a bad one but lets compare to other questions that one might consider to be in the same equivalence class easily answerable specific questions short questions how to export data from sql server 2005 to mysql 5 votes how to use the c socket api in on 5 votes if you look at the hightest-voted questions i can hardly find any which are specific technical questions so that joel 's question was so upvoted could only mean that it was upvoted based on his celebrity people have been interpreting the questions as a sort of zen-like wakeup call designed to get people talking and thinking about they way they vote i do not mean any disrespect toward joel and again i think his question was a good one this post is about joel but the boost in reputation did not imho mean joel is really good at programming and he has earned my trust as someone knowledgeable about computers it may be true that joel is a proficient computer expert but not based on the merit of that one question which leads me to an example about myself i recently gave this answer 130 reputation to a question about php 's image-creating libraries i am very appreciative of the community 's support for my answer an answer which i believe was well-thought and that i put effort into at the same time i ca look someone and tell them with a straight face that my reputation is a great reflection of my computer-related knowledge billions of people on the net have created tutorials for php 's gd image library i just happened to be the person to post a few of them heck if i know why it got 13 votes oh but please do downvote it so is built by the community so the community absolutely gets to decide what questions are important and how they choose to dispense reputation but in practice i feel like peoples reputation would be much lower if the community were more discriminating about the way they voted so am i totally off base here is this even something that can be corrected with a different reputation algorithm or am i the only one who sees this as a detriment to the so community and to be completely clear i do not intend for this to be an ad hominem and i am not jealous about not having a higher reputation but i do take reputation with a grain of salt in part for these reasons and i thought i 'd bring it up it is meta after all	do upvotes and accepted answers tend to go toward the celebrities of so possible duplicate upvoting based on celebrity too many upvotes excessive rep slurping maybe this is a hard one if not impossible to quantify but it seems like reputation builds reputation or maybe it 's just a matter of asking and answering the right questions thoughts

true	lower the required upvotes for badges in small tags update the current amount of downvotes is enough to understand the suggestion is not welcome no need to go further look at the spring tag for example skaffman is the ultimate spring helper with more than 10 of the spring questions answered with average of 2 upvotes yet he has even received a silver badge so we have a logical distinction of tags like language tags lots of questions tags less questions other tags subjective best-practices web-development etc i suggest to lower the number of votes required to gain the tag badges for the second group because these tags do have that much questions in them compared to the language tags it will encourage people to answer very specific questions which are rarely upvoted how to achieve it make the limits 300 and 750 for questions that have currently below 4000 questions total extra introduce bronze tag badges for 10-20 upvotes this would differentiate between the 2nd and the 3rd group but that 's no harm	should technology aka tag badges awarding depend on number of question on the topic possible duplicate lower the required upvotes for badges in small tags currently to obtain bronze technology badge one needs to gather 100 up votes to obtain silver and gold one need to gather 400 and 1000 up votes respectively the issue is for less popular tag it is pretty hard to even think of getting bronze badge it seems like gold one that is just because the questions wo attract large number of people so the answer might be insightful and valuable but still could end up with no up vote but be accepted what do you think i would suggest that for mature tags existing for more than one year the number of up votes to gain tag-related badge should depend on a traffic for large tags like java or 100 up votes seem just too easy to get so maybe the number should be sufficiently larger and for tags like extjs with less than 2 of their traffic 100 up votes is pretty hard to get so maybe 50 for bronze badge 100 for silver and 250 for gold would give a clearer picture of user 's competency in the subject

true	animation of the global inbox i do know if my question has any relevance or not but i was thinking if it is possible to have some animation on stack overflow for instance if a message comes then there should be a beep sound so that users can be alerted i know that presently notifications are shown in red on the global inbox to mark its presence but if user is on some other tab or browser then it is quite possible that may not reply for quite a bit of time i thought by this way the comments can easily seek some attention quickly	is there a way to setup an audible alert in response to a reply or comment it would be very convenient and useful to be able to be alerted by a notification sound when a question or answer has been replied to or commented on in one of the open tabs in my browser does such a feature exist if so how do i enable it
false	answering unpopular unanswered questions seems to be a trap for new users i 'm trying to use stack overflow but as a new user with experience in only a couple of areas it is being quite difficult to raise my reputation and be able to use all features of the site my strategy now so to speak has been to find unanswered questions in my area of expertise matlab in a way and try to provide an answer many times these questions either lack research are not explained clearly or maybe are not even matlab but math-related users posting these kind of questions are often new and frequently they do ackknowledge the answering attempts be it with a rejection additional clarification comments i 've answered four questions and one of them has received feedback from the poster in the form of comments this way all four of them ended with 0 thus i 've found myself in a point where i ca answer questions at all as i 've received the dreaded we are no longer accepting answers from this account is this supposed to happen should i avoid answering questions from non-active users so i can guarantee some feedback good or bad from the poster i guess that non-active users who only enter answer a question and then are nowhere to be seen again are not wanted but this seems to discourage answering them is it intended for now it seems to me that my only option is trying to think of clever questions even if i do currently have any edit one of the comments made me remember that one of my previous answers it was really a comment was deleted for this reason that is probably part of the reason for the ban edit2 added account link to save some clicking edit 3 nevermind a couple of my questions were undeleted by robert harvey so it looks like i get another chance thanks	should the float tag be banned a quick look at float and floats shows that there are two unrelated uses for the tags floating-point numbers and a css style is that useful to anybody should float and floats be banned from any future uses i would also suggest that any current uses be changed to floating-point or css-floating but there are over of them that have to be manually checked and edited

true	posting a solution of a problem that you faced to help newbies about an hour ago i faced a problem and tried different ways to solve it at last i was going to post my question on stack overflow but the last trick which came in my mind worked and the problem got resolved now if i want to post that problem on stack overflow with the solution which worked for me for the purpose to help other newbies to get their answer if they face the same problem what is the proper way of posting such solution to a problem	not a question but a post i want to give an explanation about something so other people will stop asking for it on a stack exchange site now how can i do that i am not asking a question so i will need to post it in another way maybe there should be an option to not ask a question but make a post or so to explain some stuff so other users can still see it but they wo have to create a question for it you may not understand this as it 's a bit vague i will edit my question when i have the time thanks for considering

false	can we have the flag counter show remaining flags not total flags i believe this is a new feature so i 'm hoping for once i 'll have an issue that is a duplicate i 've noticed the review counter is back on the bar which is great i have also noticed that it now hides the posts you have made a decision on even better what it does right now is show the total amount of flags that are available instead of those that are not yet handled by myself can this be switched	best of favorite funniest coolest questions i often see lots of questions that are along the lines of what is the best software tool for x or what is your favorite trick for x  they seem to be the sort of questions that generate the most reputation at least on serverfault i kind of do like these questions but that is just me so i am wondering what the official take is is there another question that someone should ask themselves when posting this sort of question that determines if it is appropriate i personally do mind i am looking for a good tool to do the specific task of x just the general vague ones are these good questions should they be community wiki i am sure this has been asked before but i could find it searching this site
true	can stack exchange follow a more generic approach i have been a member of stack overflow for almost a year and a half recently i 've also registered for superuser and but now i am getting a bit confused maintaining so many different accounts and sites and more same-type sites are coming through the stack exchange process all these made me feel like i want to be a member of a more generic site just one site maybe so i have a proposal you may call it stack exchange please go through my full proposal about this new se there will be just one site where anyone can ask questions on any topic and anyone can answer any question but there will be still some universal criteria for closing a question as someone has said we do want another yahoo answers the reputation and other user-specific things will be managed for the whole site questions will be tagged just as they are on the present sites but tagging will have more important roles when a tag will be used in a certain number of questions say 20k then some process can be started to define the tag as a super tag it will not be an automatic process the community will decide whether a tag will become a super tag or not for each super tag there will be a sub-domain of the main site like or or super tags could have their own domains the name may or may not be same as the super tag name there will be specific designs for each super tag as well in other words these super tags will become new sites like present different stack exchange sites any user can be queried against a super tag to get a tag-specific visitors to super tag subsites will see tag-specific user reputation for some privileges like chat and retagging the overall reputation will be used while for some other like closing a question will require tag-specific reputation some special rules can be applied to these super tags if needed normally a question can be asked under more than one super tag there may be something like tag inheritance there will be a parent tag for each tag so and vb will have dotnet as their parent google and yahoo will belong to webapps baking will belong to cooking the top level tags will have null if this can not be managed a tag may have more than one parent when a question is tagged with a child tag it will be considered tagged with all its parent tags in upper levels so it will be easier to organize different tags of the same type under one umbrella and these umbrella parent tags have higher chances to become super tags each user will be able to customize his home page and other pages by subscribing to one or more super tags so he will just see specific types of questions and the other questions will not bother him keeping this stack overflow ideology in mind is stackoverflow becoming too generic if this scheme is implemented i think the following problems will be solved users have to keep track of many similar sites i am now tracking 5 but wishing to register with some other but it will be tough i think users get annoyed when questions are closed for being off-topic sometimes even migration to the relevant site is not possible due to the unavailability or immaturity of that sub-site but in this new system simply editing tags of a question will suffice there will be no hassle of migrating questions from one site to another sometimes people do not know which is the exact place to ask a question there are many similar types of sites i have seen same question is asked in different sites and responses are very much different with an universal community we may get better answers choosing new se sites is relatively difficult the process is quite lengthy and after the lengthy process still possibility is there that the new sub-site will not succeed then all the questions-answers and other activities are wasted i would like to have stack exchange as a global community for knowledge-sharing through questions and answers update i think most important flaw raised in the idea is ambiguous tag this happened probably because of my flawed baking cooking tag inheritance example i think it will not be a very problematic issue if users go directly to the sub-domains or super-tags but when someone is asking in the main site sometimes it is a problem though do know how much severe does anyone has any ideas to solve this i have already stated mine in the comments update 2 i assume people are thinking that this whole idea is a completely different pattern comparing with the present one so backward compatibily is almost impossible but actually backward compatibility is very much possible only with a few tweakings in the tagging we just have to add some more tags to the questions and that will include them in the relevant super tag or sub-sites because of the tag-inheritance for example stackexchange programming development programmers subjective suggestion discussion superuser feature usage serverfault server database the relevant tags for a sub-site or super-tag can be viewed if someone goes to the tags section of the present sites and if any of the tags can not be applied the super-tag itself can be applied easily so the migration from stack exchange to stack exchange may take time but still possible update 3 these days se has tag subscription and filters we can query reputation specific to tags though not same the reason for my tag-inheritance is same as filters though filters just group tags no inheritance complexity now maybe my proposal is somewhat half implemented but i still want an integrated interface for all se sites hope someday we shall get it	a routing location for questions that ca be categorized in the past i have tried to ask questions on a stackexchange website that is what i believe to be related to that website what i find that tends to happen is that if the staff at that website is nice enough they will move the question to the appropriate website but that is always the case the stackexchange network should have a general routing website where you can post a question and perhaps a committed staff team could direct the question to the appropriate website

false	how to request fixes in tag descriptions how do i request improvements in tag descriptions specifically the cocos2d tag description has a blatant mistake cocos2d is a python based open source framework for building 2d games and graphical applications for windows mac and linux desktop computers cocos2d is published under a bsd license i would say cocos2d is not python based at all unless i 'm missing something if i am not mistaken cocos2d started off purely as an objective-c framework these days they favor engine cross-plataformness by using some other languages like in cocos2d-x or for scripting in many of the cocos2d subprojects also marginally related how can i request tag renames tag merges edit oh i realized that maybe cocos2d did actually start as a python engine however i still think that giving prominence to that in the tag is suboptimal as cocos2d really took off thanks to the objective-c version i support what they are requesting on this question merge the cocos2d and the cocos2d-iphone tags make the first a synonym of the second	do let me complete reviews while i 'm banned from editing i 'm not going to get in the debates and discussions about the ban itself i do dispute it or the length or why i 'd suggest that if you ban my edit ability for 7 days i think you should also take away my ability to do reviews otherwise it 's like grading an english paper without a red pen as a secondary question what should i do for things i spot in the interim for the full details keep reading below per my learning lessons from yesterday on different post here i got the 7 day ban on editing there is no dispute or misunderstanding about that the pitfall of this is that my ability to conduct reviews on new poster activity was not taken away which is odd but no complaint from me just yet the resulting dilemma is that now as a reviewer or even going across pages i encounter things that i now properly understand need to be edited and ca i can make the suggestion in a comment to adjust the formatting and did so on the new poster review and i wo perform any others until i get some feedback from this question i suppose the best thing here is to skip it so someone else can fix the formatting later even if not me rejecting it seems harsh and clearly unfair to the user and just wrong flagging it for a moderator seems like a waste of moderator time but i 'm happy to do that if that 's the best course of action in short should i bookmark stuff like this to fix later once my ban is lifted does this essentially encourage me to get off the site completely for the week and then repeat my old ways as opposed to actually being given the opportunity to demonstrate i 've learned what i did wrong

true	what is the purpose of closing a question having been a member of stack overflow for a year i have participated in reviewing close votes and flagging questions if i found any duplicates however i do understand the purpose of closing a question as per myself the main purpose is keeping the site clean and make a better place i still see closed questions on the site that are a year old when will these questions be deleted also when a does get deleted it is still visible to 10k users even if it is deleted by the owner every day i participate in reviewing close votes but the question arises why we are preserving these questions and answers even after they are closed	why bother closing questions this is sort of an so zeitgeist question i thought i might dig into the python backlog there are 800 pages of questions to clear out of some of the fluff there are a lot of questions that are basic python questions along the lines of how do i write a list comprehension they are question and answer so short-term they serve a purpose long term they probably do then i started wondering about why they should be closed if you go scrolling back through pages of old questions closed questions appear there anyways i do have rep to vote to close yet anyways so it does matter in any case while i get a lot of value out of this site there are some parts of the moderation system i do completely understand so i thought i 'd ask this particular question is a symptom not really the underlying question but maybe it will help the difference between these old questions that are closed and old questions that are closed appears to be nothing they still show up in browsing they still show up in search results as the short faq says the best answers and questions appear by voting them up or down voting a bad question down pushes it out of visibility most of the time anyways what value is gained by closing them as opposed to just voting them down
true	how do i get attention for old unanswered questions i asked a question almost as soon as i get my account i got a few decent answers but i did get the information i wanted the question has long since become buried by newer questions and there 's still no accepted answer unfortunately because there are six answers it probably looks to a casual observer like the question was answered and i just neglected to mark any answer as accepted so what 's the protocol for me to try to get this question answered i see several options post the question a second time possibly linking to the original to get it back onto the new page this is encouraged on sites like reddit however it 's probably not appropriate here since we 're encouraged to check for dupes and not submit a question that 's already been asked by someone else so this probably falls under that heading wait for some kind of wiki-like talk page to be implemented then post a plea on the talk page for input and hope that activity on the talk page bumps up the question do nothing further on the stack overflow website if i edit my post to say that i have accepted any of the current answers but are looking for more then the question might get answered eventually by people browsing through old questions to find something they can answer post the question on other sites but link to my original question on stack overflow people will either answer here or they 'll answer on the other site and i can post the accepted answer here myself this might be considered spamming for stack overflow so it might be better to do this without the link for more information see the what should i do if no one answers my question page in the help center return to faq index	promoting a question in the active list possible duplicate how do i get attention for old unanswered questions i see that editing makes your post 1 in the stackoverflow homepage ok which else activities promote it i advise that there would be a button for that to reduce duplicates i think that people create duplicates because they see that existing answers are unsatisfactory if they do not want to add anything to the question they could just promote it again to the people eyes
