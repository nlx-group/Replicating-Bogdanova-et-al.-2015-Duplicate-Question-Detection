duplicate	Who is the Community? Or, how can community earn badges?<p>Sometimes I see a post being edited by community, or brought to the active page by community. I have seen this post <a href="http://meta.physics.stackexchange.com/questions/4510/what-does-it-mean-if-an-edit-is-attributed-to-community">What does it mean if an edit is attributed to Community?</a>, but still if this is exactly the case, how has the user <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/users/-1/community">community</a> earned those two badges? I mean the ones in Arena 51.</p> 	Community User has just 1 account?<p>I noticed that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/-1/community">Community♦ user</a> was active recently(I lost 4 reps on SO and gained 4 on MSO) so I just checked the profile for <strong>him/her/it</strong>.</p>  <p>First of all, I just noticed that only <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/users/-1/community">Area51</a> account was being listed under the <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/-1/community?tab=accounts">SE accounts section</a>. Then I further noticed that it was because our dear "Community" has earned 2 bronze badges on Area51(namely <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/badges/203/advocate?userid=-1">Advocate</a> and <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/badges/7/filibuster?userid=-1">Filibuster</a>).</p>  <p>So, how can it be so that it can earn badges only at Area51 and not on SO/MSO or other sister sites for the same actions?</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/el5QR.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/el5QRs.png" alt="On SO"></a></p>  <p><sub>On Stack Overflow</sub></p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4qhu2.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4qhu2s.png" alt="On MSO"></a></p>  <p><sub>On Meta Stack Overflow</sub></p> 
non-duplicate	What to do with cross-site duplicates?<p>What's the right course of action for cross-site duplicates?</p>  <p>There are two flavors:</p>  <ol> <li><p>A question is posted which belongs on another site and ends up already having been asked there. I can't find an example right now, but it's bound to happen soon if it hasn't already.</p></li> <li><p>The same question is posted in two places at the same time. Take <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1119081/what-do-you-use-to-upload-your-files-code-documents-to-a-live-server">this SO question</a> for example, which is a duplicate of <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/39804/best-syncing-tool">this SF question</a>, posted within a half hour of each other by the same user.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Possible actions:</p>  <ul> <li>Move it to the proper site and close it once it gets there as a duplicate.</li> <li>Provide a way to close it right away as a cross-site duplicate, without moving it first.</li> <li>Flag it and let a moderator merge them.</li> <li>Close it as "no longer relevant" or something else.</li> </ul>  <p>Additionally, flavor 2 is a bit of a special case; perhaps the question really spans both sites in terms of content and intended audience. Should multiple-postings in this case be allowed? If so, should they somehow be linked to each other? If not, how do we avoid a migration war?</p> 	Add Menlo as monospace font for Mac OS 10.6 users<p>Mac OS 10.6 (a.k.a.

duplicate	Some detail on @Username: why doesn't Stack Overflow write a link to the referred user?<p>I've read the post <em><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/43019/how-do-comment-replies-work">How do comment @replies work?</a></em>, but I am not sure I understood how to refer correctly to a user, for example, <strong>Sha Wiz Dow Ard</strong>. If I got it right, I have to write @ShaWizDowArd because spaces must be ignored.</p>  <p>Does it mean that there are no users called "ShaWizDowArd", "ShaWiz DowAr", because they wouldn't be unique usernames?</p>  <p>Talking about name + surname, does it mean that if there's a user called "John Smith" I can't register as "JohnSmith" or "John-Smith"?</p>  <p>How can I be sure my @referral is correctly written and interpreted? Is there a way to know if I referred to the right person? Why don't you write a link in "href style" to the user I'm referring to?</p> 	Let's make it easier to reply within comments!<p>Here's my proposal.  Every comment has a '<strong>Reply</strong>' link after it.  Clicking on this link adds the standard <strong>@UserName:</strong> to the comment edit box.</p>  <p>After posting, the <strong>@UserName:</strong> is converted into a javascript '<em>link</em>'.  By '<em>link</em>' I mean that it appears to be a hyperlink, but is actually a span with the hyperlink style and javascript in its <strong>onmouseover</strong> event.  When you hover over this link, the comment it references is highlighted in some fashion (background color changes, its outlined, whatever).</p>  <p>When the referenced comment is hidden, one of two things can happen:</p>  <p>1) The comments section is expanded and unshown comments are revealed, or<br /> 2) A hovering div appears next to the pointer containing the comment that is referenced.</p>  <p>No. 2 is probably easier to implement.</p>

But to get someone to go there, one continues in the comment thread to say 'hey, let's go to chat'</p>  <p>Using <code>@ThePersonsNameYouWantToChatWith</code> in chat doesn't seem to give them a notification; how can one notify them that you are said something in chat to them?</p> 	Data explorer query values in cookies<p>My userid still isn't automatically populated in the <code>##UserId##</code> field in data explorer (I've tried updating my avatar etc), so it would be handy if my userid was stored in a cookie and populated automatically.</p>  <p>But it got me thinking, why aren't <em>all</em> query variables saved as cookies and automatically populated into fields?</p>  <p>Does this sound like a good idea?</p>

Here is a sample of the feedback we've provided so far </p>  <ul> <li>Pick up a good C++ book and learn the actual language. </li> <li>The problem here is that you have no idea about C++</li> <li>And why in the world are you converting Managed code to Unmanaged? </li> </ul>  <p>All of these have been flagged. But given the load on the moderators this question was closed and the user resorted to apologizing in several comments for his inability to google well enough all while the hostile comments / answers remain.  </p>  <p>Does anyone seriously think the OP is going to post here again?  </p>  <p>Why do we accept this as OK? Why can five users, who would comment only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM" rel="nofollow">RTFM</a> if we allowed them, dictate the reputation of the site? Why does it take so long for hostile comments to be removed? Why do we let people who post hostile comments keep posting at all?  </p>  <p>If you want to scream RTFM then may I suggest LKML. There should be no place for you on Stack Overflow.</p>

non-duplicate	Oy! Animated ads!<p>Stack Overflow delivered a little piece of coal to me, today (or I noticed it for the first time today). Animated GIFs as ads.

This is the only ad I've found that doesn't present the little "like this"/"don't like this" thumbs, possibly related to its GIF nature (in Chrome 31. I can mark it down in IE 11, but I've restrained from doing so, for science).</p>  <p>The thought crossed my mind that this was malware, but I've reproduced this on my locked-down work laptop.</p>  <p>It's really irritating, flashing away while I'm writing an answer. Can we, here and now, say <em>NO!</em> to animated GIF ads?</p> 	Why are the number of up/down votes secret in meta?<p>Frequently when I'm facing a situation in stackoverflow where I'm not sure what the expected behavior/etiquette is I go to meta to look it up.</p>  <p>A lot of times when I'm looking through meta questions I see questions with <code>+1</code> reputation or <code>0</code> reputation. In stackoverflow I can click that number (having more than 1000 reputation) and gain a much better understanding of how the community feels about that answer/question.</p>  <p>I understand that since stackoverflow has a lot of traffic <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/747/show-total-votes-or-up-down-votes/1007#1007">showing downvotes and upvotes is expensive</a> for all users in stackoverflow. </p>  <p>However in meta I feel that knowing the ratio between downvotes and upvotes in meta is crucial to differentiating something that did not get enough attention from a highly debated subject (or people don't have a strong opinion on, and something people do). If I see a question with <code>0</code> often I can not tell if the community does not care or it is highly debated.</p>  <p><strong>In short:</strong></p>  <p>I would like to know <em>why</em> meta enforces the 1000 reputation limit for showing up/down votes?</p>  <p>What are some advantages and disadvantages to it in the context of <em>meta</em>?</p>

non-duplicate	profile: non-web website URLs get rewritten<p>I can be blamed for trying to use the "website" field in my profile for something not in the web, but currently, if I read "website" as "some personal place in the Internet" and try to set it to my gopherhole URL, <code>gopher://sdf-eu.org/1/users/njsg</code>, it is silently accepted but it is stored as <code>http://gopher://sdf-eu.org/1/users/njsg</code>, and that is the target of the link in the profile, even if it just reads <code>gopher://sdf-eu.org/1/users/…</code>.</p>  <p>That's also what it shows when I ask to edit the profile again, so it's not something at visualization level, but something related to parsing when changing the profile that only happens once.</p>  <p>So my question here is whether it is possible to remove this rewriting, so that I — and possibly others (one can dream there are some gopher users out there in SE, right?) — can list my gopherhole as the "personal space out there in the Internet", or whether this can at least be trapped so that people don't end up thinking their non-web URL has been accepted when it was, in fact, interpreted as a HTTP URL.</p> 	Selection to code syntax on ipad<p>It's nearly impossible to use the editor's toolbar on an iPad, in case you have a selection on the first line text inside the editor.

There are very important elements there, like the election announcement in the community bulletin, very useful elements like the favorite tags and interesting ones like the Area 51 stats for beta sites. </p>  <p>Then there are those elements I never found any use for, the list of recent tags and the list of recent badges, and the list of related tags when you don't have any tags selected, e.g. on <code>/questions</code>. </p>  <p>Those elements should just be removed from the sidebar, they are just not important and useful enough to be visible on the frontpage or the <code>/questions</code> page, which are probably the most visited pages of any SE site.</p>  <p>The related questions and tags feature are also pretty useful, but they consume a lot of space, it might make sense to display fewer elements by default for those, but add a "more" link that expands the list of related tags/questions. Or maybe this link should lead to a new site showing related tags/questions with some additional sort option, e.g. based on tags.</p>  <p>One might argue that having those elements on the sidebar doesn't hurt, they're below the more important ones and don't really take any room away from those. But the recent debate about the election notification produced some anecdotal evidence that a significant number of user completely ignore the sidebar. Focusing the sidebar on the essential elements that are actually used a lot by users might help to lower the number of users that just ignore everything on that sidebar. </p>  <p>The SE team has certainly data on the usage of the sidebar available, I have to resort to guessing here. I strongly suspect that the "recent tags" and "recent badges" sidebar elements are rarely used at all, but I can't actually prove this. </p>

The great thing with such a knowledge base is that its entries are subjects of constant development and improvement. You know, it's some sort of <em>normalization</em> - instead of having a-thousand-and-growing quick-n-dirty answers from passers-by there is a single one, written and polished by professionals. (A small but indicative detail: on SO, if you have your answer in constant development and improvement, it will be taken from you).</p>  <p>But Stack Overflow is not a forum. It is more like an anonymous imageboard to its participants - they scarcely know each other; they have no idea on the background, on the history, on the other questions or answers. Their only intention is to give a quick answer in pursuit of a few reputation points. This makes answers quality below any acceptable level. Yes, sometimes some professional feels like writing a detailed answer, or an experienced developer smells the <em>real</em> question under the phrased one and answers properly. But the worst thing with professional developers is that <strong>they don't have too much spare time to hang out on imageboards.</strong> They have work to do. But all the newcomers, who don't care to search even a little - they won't wait! Yet there are always some <em>enthusiasts</em> hanging around, eager to answer. So, we have Stack Overflow bloated with thousands of repeated questions with bad answers.</p>  <p>As a programmer, I find this approach <em>extremely inefficient</em>. Having the same answer scattered in thousands of posts makes it hell to maintain. So - all the wrong and outdated answers remains in place.</p>  <p>Okay, a few people who care are trying to create some sort of "reference questions". <em>Even if they succeed against strong community reluctance ("this doesn't fit for SO!")</em> - they'll find all their effort in vain. It's imageboard, Luke! Nobody ever cares about such questions' existence. Or - even if someone is aware of the already existing answer - they have a choice: <strong>to answer and get some points, or to vote for closure and get nothing.</strong> What would <em>you</em> choose, %username%?</p>  <p>Yes, I know, it's the perfect forum I have pictured above. In reality newcomers are often sent into a FAQ section inappropriately - that's why forums are despised. Okay, this thing about forums is an extreme. <em>But Stack Overflow is just an opposite extreme!</em> which is no better.</p>  <p>Although I do understand the intention - "a quick answer without questions", I also understand that knowledge that cost you no effort will do no good either. I only pray that physicians have no such a site where one can ask "how to perform an appendectomy". <strong>And get an answer.</strong></p>  <p>Something has to be done about it. No, the status quo is no good. Because</p>  <h2>The Rules That Never Work.</h2>  <p>A distinct thing is Stack Overflow's set of rules. Every time you raise a problem on Meta, they always have a solution for you. Say, "there is a bad question" - "vote to close it". Nobody cares if it never takes a proper number of votes. Nobody cares if it already has an answer (so - there is no point in closing it at all). Nobody cares at all.</p>  <p>This problem is somewhat similar to one on the main site: <strong>Nobody cares about solving a problem</strong>, but only to answer a question (though most formal and useless way).</p>  <h2>Meta Site.</h2>  <p>This is a rather funny one. Some people dedicate themselves not to answering questions but to answering questions on answering questions. So, they have no real picture of the things, but always have an opinion on them. They can answer any question in the world. The only problem with their answer - it is totally useless. By closing a question that states a problem it's impossible to solve a problem. It's like a child who closes his eyes and thinks that nobody sees him too.</p>  <p>In their imagination everything is all right and perfect: there are wise laws and dedicated community to solve every problem in one click. So, there is nothing to discuss - they always have an answer. Every <em>question</em> has been answered already. Who cares if the <em>problem</em> persists? </p>  <p>The only reply you can get here (if you read between the lines) is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"This site is for asking questions and getting answers, and not for solving problems. So, get out of here and let us continue chatting on wonderful subjects like inappropriate comma in the tag description or a temporary fault in the reputation calculations."</p> </blockquote>  <p>Even the button name proves it: not "Start Discussion" but "Ask Question". So, Meta takes itself as a some sort of fast-food joint - "Get your grub and get out! This is not a place for discussions!". But I wish there was one.</p> 	Begin focusing more on searching than asking<p>Just a thought. I have noticed that many, many more questions are getting duplicated on SO. </p>  <p>This may be partly due to availability of searching within SO. I know SO questions appear frequently in Google searches with anything relating to that question, but maybe if more of an emphasis was put on the internal SO searching. It could encourage users to browse before getting to the asking stage. Feel free to agree or disagree.</p> 
non-duplicate	Inconsistency of button positions in review queues<p>The buttons of 4 of the review queues can be characterized as positive, somewhat positive, negative and neutral (skip). The problem is that the order of the buttons is not consistent across the review queues:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Uni4e.png" alt="Review queue buttons characterized"></p> </blockquote>  <p><sup>Please don't downvote, because there is no hand drawn circle or arrow.</sup></p>  <h2>small Proposition</h2>  <p>At least exchange the <code>Edit</code> and the <code>Recommend Deletion</code> buttons in the low quality review queue. This would mean the least problems with the community.</p>  <p>Changing the order of the reopen votes review queue buttons might be strange since there could be different reasons behind the ordering.</p>  <h2>big Proposition</h2>  <p>It would be probably best if all the buttons would be ordered like: positive, somewhat positive, negative and <em>skip</em>. This would mean that Suggested Edits, Close Votes and Reopen Votes need to be reordered. If reviewers who are not looking anymore where they click but know what they what to achieve, this will lead to some wrong clicks during the time of adaption but more correct clicks in the long run.</p>  <h2>Why is this my problem?</h2>  <p>I have failed some audits in the suggested edits and low quality posts review queues because of the inconsistencies. Since the suggested edits queue is a "high speed" queue, I begin to move the mouse to the right position before I have finally decided. If I reviewed some posts in the low quality queue before that, I am in a different mindset which means I will move the mouse to the wrong position when I want to reject an edit. The same happens in the other direction.</p>  <p>Currently, this is only a problem with review audits because an audit doesn't let me notice my error, but I will immediately fail the audit. This is not a problem with real reviews since edit/improve and delete/reject need a second action. It would be better if I didn't even had to notice my error.</p>  <h2>Why is this a problem?</h2>  <p>Review queues are not "full". You have to jump between the queues frequently. Every time you go to another queue, you need to keep in mind that the action layout has changed. This introduces unnecessary stress to the reviewer.</p> 	Invalid username?<p>I just came across this highly active user: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/495470/495470">http://stackoverflow.com/users/495470/495470</a></p>  <p>Who's username is the unicode character <code>U+0618 ARABIC SMALL FATHA</code>.</p>  <p>At least on my mac, that character has 0px width and therefore cannot be selected or clicked on, and it's generally a pain in the ass to refer to the user when discussing a question.</p>  <p>Is it OK for users to have a username like that? I think it should be banned, you should have to have at least one "normal" character in your username. Special unicode characters, especially diacritics should not be allowed?</p>

duplicate	Why aren't people voting for questions?<p>While at least some answers from every question seem to have been up-voted as a "helpful" answer:</p>  <ul> <li>about 49% of questions have score of 0 or 1.</li> <li>another 21% of questions have a score of 2.</li> </ul>  <p><em>Most</em> questions seem to have an answer or two with score +5. Is it that we have a lot of fluff questions and not useful ones? Or perhaps it just seems more natural to vote for answers than questions? If we want the most useful info on Stack Overflow to filter to the top, how can this disparity be fixed?</p>  <p>I think this may cause real problems for people getting the badges which require +25 or +100 votes on questions.</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Edit</strong>: I like a lot of the feedback I'm seeing. Two problems are highlighted:</p>  <ol> <li>The work flow doesn't promote voting for questions the way it promotes voting for answers. One solution: when a user answers a question, the system should invite them to vote for the question.  If someone cares enough to answer a question, then they care enough to vote for it as well.</li> <li>Users with less than 15 reputation cannot vote for questions or answers. Is this warranted?  Maybe these users could provisionally vote for questions and answers and those ratings would only take effect when the user reaches 15 reputation?</li> </ol>  <hr>  <p><strong>Edit</strong>: I had no idea this post would be this popular -- or that this would still be a problem by now.   </p>  <p><em>All I ask is this. As you browse Stack Overflow, when you see a good question: <strong>vote for it.</em></strong></p>  <p>If everyone does, then this problem will disappear.</p> 	Why aren't people voting?<p>I noticed people aren't voting that much. At least not as much as me, I vote for more than 70% of the questions I see, and more than 50% of each answer.</p>  <p>In fact, I haven't found a single question or answer with more than 2 days that had a <code>max(total_question_votes; answer_1_total_votes; ...; answer_n_total_votes)/views</code> ratio superior to 10%.

I know there is a policy against topics that lead to debates, but my observation indicates that there must be value to aggregating "debates".  When studying a new aspect of programming, these debates can quickly catch someone up on major views and pros/cons, even when there is no definite answer (which is also useful information!!! scientist speaking here).</p>  <p>Has there been any testing to see if there is actually any significant downside to keeping these open?

See SSCCE.org for guidance.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I'm pretty sure that reason doesn't make sense for that question, but since that question is way off topic, I don't know what reason I should have used.

non-duplicate	Should tag reputation be made available on the user profile (and API)?<p>StackOverflow reputation has turned into a handy currency for people to use in determing expertise. Some employers are using it; some people are using it as a useful proxy measure for inquisitiveness, knowledge, communication, programming ability (hmm... doesn't correlate with being able to answer questions), intelligence (double hmm...), sex appeal (now we are getting silly) and so on. But the raw reputation score isn't that useful if you want to find out how good the person is in a particular language or technology niche. The fact that someone has 5,000 reputation is a nice thing to know if you are trying to decide whether to give them a job as a C# developer - but if that's 5,000 points all from subjective and not-programming-related, it's not quite so much of a ringing endorsement.</p>  <p>Would it be possible then to expose reputation grouped by tags for users? Would it be desirable? Would it be possible to have in the API? This data is already available in the form of the leaderboards on the tag stats page - e.g. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged?tagnames=c%23&amp;sort=stats&amp;pagesize=50">c#</a> - could and should it be available on the user profile and potentially elsewhere?</p>  <p>The API brings out some possibilities for using this data elsewhere. Imagine <a href="http://php.net/" rel="nofollow">php.net</a> reborn with StackOverflow reputation information from PHP-related questions sitting next to posted code samples in the comments section (some of which is awful, old deprecated code). Same for blogs, issue trackers and the like. Imagine if you are working on a Java library - you log into your bug tracker and sort the newly-reported issues by StackOverflow reputation for the java tag. You'd get a rough idea that the issues reported are likely to be from people who don't need to be pummelled with a clue-by-four and can address them first (alternatively: if they are so smart and have all that reputation, they ought to fix it themselves and send a patch). Ought it be possible for external sites to be able to use this kind of data?</p> 	Why was this Very low quality flag disputed?<p>I just flagged <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/19935100/851811">this answer</a> as "Very low quality", and the flag got disputed. </p>  <p>In my opinion the answer fits well in the descriptions of the VLQ flag given <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/189373/169503">here</a> and <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/93606/169503">here</a>.

(Or, <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/104782/169503">Is the “very low quality” flag necessary?</a>)</p>  <p>Why did it get disputed? Was this a good VLQ flag?</p>

I see often enough, and twice today just casually following new questions, a new user post a question that does not pass muster for any number of reasons, only to receive a large number of downvotes.  In one of those instances, the user contacted me as one of the closers, frustrated, not understanding what happened to his question or how to fix it.</p>  <p>This can be demoralizing, especially if the comments are sarcastic rather than helpful.</p>  <p>I would suggest instead that a question from a "new" user that attracts a threshold of downvotes be automatically placed on hold, and a comment be automatically appended to the question welcoming the user to the site and providing a link to read up on how to ask a good question for StackOverflow.  Let them know (as experienced users do) that they can remove the negative reputation by deleting the question, and that they can ask a new, better formulated version of the question.</p>  <p>A "new" user might be one below a certain reputation threshold, or each user might be allowed one instance of special handling ever.</p> 	Autocomment when voting to close as duplicate<p>Another solution to <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/40316/add-an-alert-when-answering-a-question-that-has-at-least-a-close-vote-as-duplicat">this problem</a>:</p>  <h3>Problem:</h3>  <p>People are voting to close as exact duplicate without leaving comments.  Such votes are invisible to everyone under 3k.  A comment is the primary way others can see that there's a duplicate until the question is actually closed.  Until people are notified, the question may get answers that really should go to the primary question.</p>  <h3>Possible solution:</h3>  <ul> <li>When voting to close as exact duplicate, the system <em>automatically</em> adds a question comment, <code>Possible duplicate of -link-</code></li> <li>It would search the comments for the number of the duplicate, and if found it wouldn't add the new comment (ie, someone has already pointed out the dupe) but if not then it would add the comment.  This will also repress extra comments as others add their vote to close, unless they chose a different dupe primary.</li> <li>The comment would be either under the community user, or the user that voted to close as duplicate</li> </ul>  <p>This would give us the same information we had when people manually marked questions with dupe info, and the same information we get when people comment on the question about the dupe.  Automating it would make it a little faster and consistent.</p>

A high edit count is more indicative of a user's editing habits than it is of the quality of the post.

non-duplicate	posting questions: make tag selection more seamless and less error-prone<p>This question was posted using the Android App.</p>  <p>When posting questions using the Android Application, tag selection can be a little tricky &amp; error-prone.</p>  <p>The web application provides an auto completion list of suggestions as you type, but no such list appears in the Android app. It would be very useful if similar functionality could be implemented there.</p>  <p>Also it appears that entering a new tag is friction-free, as might happen when fat fingering a tag. As a demonstration I have tagged this question with a false tag.  It should not be this easy to create a new tag, as I would guess the majority of these cases would be mistakes.</p> 	Keep "convert to comment" button enabled if the answer does not have a freeform comment<p>Since SO now has <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/143640/147015">"native" support for common comments on bad answers</a> it would be nice if those comments would not disable the "convert to comment" button in the mod queue.</p>  <p>It could even improve the "not an answer" queue by automatically displaying answers there which were not flagged but got one of the related comments.</p>  <p>To make it even better that feature should not rely on the comment being posted via the new tool but check the string itself (in a way that also matches the comments created by the <a href="http://stackapps.com/q/2116/3360">popular userscript</a>)</p>

duplicate	Why are there so many users with low "reputation" points?<p>I see that many of the questions posted all have really low reputations points, from 1-50.  Given that you get points for simply editing and selecting answers, I find this hard to believe.</p>  <p>It makes me less likely to want to answer questions as it seems these users create accounts just to mine information and then open up another account for their next question.</p>  <p>Why not give users more incentives to use the site as an actual user and not just a place to mine information?</p>  <p>For example - the ability to delete down-voted posts, the ability to block users ( trolls, etc. ).  Basically any of the things popular social sites have?</p> 	Encouraging users to create an account (and keep it)<p>I know SO's policy is "you don't have to register to ask questions," but there are so many new members and so many hit-and-runs... The majority of the questions I see now are coming from new users (i.e., it's their first question). </p>  <p>Although unregistered users should still be able to ask questions, I think we should encourage users to create an account. Here is a couple of ways we could do that:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Explicitly encourage people to get an account: there's currently nothing telling people to do that. Maybe tell people something like "Get an account, it's easy!" and maybe show some of the perks of having an account (and having rep).</p></li> <li><p>Maybe give a few bonus points for registering; and have that enable a basic privilege. It could be taken from one of the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/privileges/new-user">new user restrictions</a>, for example.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Of course getting people to register is just half of the battle. I don't know what the stats are on this, but I think there's a number of users who create multiple accounts anyways. We could curb that by:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Having smart(er)? duplicate account detection systems, alerting someone who is about to create a new account and possibly has an account already. Give them a message like "Hey, it looks like you already have <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/current">this</a> account, are you sure you want to create a new one?"</p></li> <li><p>Create a new privilege (10k? 20k?) that gives users tools to detect possible duplicate accounts, eg: "List users with the same e-mail," "List users with the same IP addresses,"  etc. (without revealing said emails and IPs).</p>  <p>Then the 10k/20k can look at other stuff (e.g.: posts) and refer the new user to a moderator for a possible merge.</p></li> </ol>

non-duplicate	Provisional upvotes - for those answers you're not quite sure about<p>I've just seen an answer that I liked. It was:   </p>  <ul> <li>well thought out  </li> <li>well laid out  </li> <li>of a good length  </li> <li>the only answer given so far  </li> </ul>  <p>However I cannot bring myself to upvote it <strong>yet</strong> - because despite what I said above, I do not know if it is the correct answer to the problem (not without whipping up some test code). IOW, the truthness factor is high, but I don't want to up vote something where I don't know if it is correct.</p>  <p>This is a shame for the person who posted that answer, because I have just moved on and they won't ever get the up vote their answer deserves - unless I keep visiting the page to see if it has been marked as the correct answer.</p>  <p>So... what about a provisional upvote feature? In this feature the upvote is kept in a pending state and gets awarded once the OP marks the answer as correct (marks it as the accepted answer).</p>  <p><strong>What does this solve?</strong> Well, nothing really, because there isn't a <em>problem</em> as such. But it would be nice to be able to reward an answer when it is proven to be correct and the reader is not in a position to make a call on its technical accuracy at that point in time.  </p>  <p><strong>Will this cannabalize real votes?</strong> I don't believe so - if I know an answer is good then I will up vote it immediately.

duplicate	Scope and wording of "minimal understanding of the problem" close category<p>It seems to me that the subject category comprehends not only "understanding of the problem" but also "effort to solve".

There are a few specific things we need your help with:</p>  <p><strong>URL</strong> - <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/fr">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/fr</a></p>  <ul> <li>Are any of the translations inappropriate?  Are any of the translations misleading?</li> <li>Do the URL’s on /fr all continue to /fr endpoints, or are you getting thrown off to another site by mistake?</li> <li>Do you see any English text that has been left untranslated?  </li> <li>If you venture to the employer side, is any of the pricing information not denominated in EUROS?</li> <li>Have any of the translations caused strange wrapping issues or overlapping text?  </li> </ul>  <p>We’d really appreciate any feedback you have, and will be working throughout the week to put the final touches on the site.  Our public launch date (other than this one of course) will be on May 25th at the Rejoignez une Startup event in Paris.  And for our French Canadian friends, we’ll be following up shortly with a Careers 2.0 experience dedicated just for you.</p>

duplicate	Why are the moderators being so strict with quality related flags recently?<p>I recently flagged a question as 'very low quality' just like I've flagged many questions in the past. However, my flag was found to be unhelpful this time. The same thing happened when I recently flagged a post as not an answer.</p>  <p>Are the moderators being more strict when it comes to handling quality related flags? If so, why?</p>  <p><a href="/q/7931">Return to FAQ index</a></p> 	My flagging is not deemed helpful<p>I am flagging posts on SO which do not appear to be helpful to the site.

non-duplicate	Wikipedia style notice and warning markup?<p>Please see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1104064/run-php-script-from-python">this question</a> which is nearly an exact duplicate of another. Would it be possible to make certain CSS elements available to editors so that certain edits can be quickly and easily differentiated from the original question?</p>  <p>Messages that could appear in such boxes are:</p>  <ul> <li><strong>Your question is almost an exact duplicate of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">this question</a>. Please consider revising your question to indicate why answers to the duplicate do not fit your need.</strong></li> <li><strong>Your question appears to be purely subjective in nature, please consider adding specific technical elements to your question.</strong></li> <li><strong>Your question is inflamatory and may be closed quickly unless it is revised</strong></li> </ul>  <p>... Or, others.</p>  <p>This strongly differentiates the views of the Stack&nbsp;Overflow community from the original poster and helps nudge poorly written questions into well written questions, when possible.</p>  <p>Additionally, if someone uses this special markup (maybe %$ ... message ... %$), the user sees a new comment from "so-community".</p>  <p>Sorry if this has been raised before, I did not find it.</p> 	Fix the polluted browsing for stack overflows by tag<p>I consider this question to be (in spirit) a duplicate of this other post:</p>  <p><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/60350/remove-tag-synonym-stack-overflow-stackoverflow">Remove tag synonym [stack-overflow] -&gt; [stackoverflow]</a></p>  <p>...unfortunately the bounty I opened on that ended without having drawn any additional attention.  Thus, I won't be trying that bump method again. :-/</p>  <p><strong>LET ME BE CLEAR</strong>: I am not proposing a different course of action than the one given by the person who posted that question.  I want the same thing: for the existing questions tagged <code>[stackoverflow]</code> to be reset to <code>[stack-overflow]</code> (that's for the computer science phenomenon). Then repurpose <code>[stackoverflow]</code> as a synonym for <code>[stackoverflow.com]</code> to be monitored for migration to meta.</p>  <p>However, I'm pointing specifically to the user experience of tag searches right now, which is bad...</p>  <hr>  <p>My motivation actually came from searching for tags about stack overflows, using the tag whose description says it's the official tag for the CS concept (<a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stackoverflow" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;stackoverflow&#39;" rel="tag">stackoverflow</a>).  It is generally a cue for migration, and things that have been migrated show up in tag browsing in the tag list...without the ability to remove or edit it.</p>  <p>My preference is for tags that have hyphens in them; I like <code>linked-list</code> better than <code>linkedlist</code> for instance.  So <code>stack-overflow</code> works for me for me...and I agree with this post that the conventions should be mapped out clearly in general:</p>  <p><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/75155/tag-synonym-improvement">http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/75155/tag-synonym-improvement</a></p>  <p>Leaving <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stackoverflow" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;stackoverflow&#39;" rel="tag">stackoverflow</a> for people to monitor for migration seems useful...as is making it synonym for the existing <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stackoverflow.com" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;stackoverflow.com&#39;" rel="tag">stackoverflow.com</a>.  There's a <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stackoverflow-api" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;stackoverflow-api&#39;" rel="tag">stackoverflow-api</a> too.</p> 
non-duplicate	Add unaccepted questions back to the Unanswered Questions for users with high acceptance rate<p>Now that the Acceptance Rate is implemented for all users, I think it can be useful to put back some of the unaccepted questions in the Unanswered Questions group.</p>  <p>I'm saying this because some questions are not marked as answer simply because a suitable answer hasn't been found yet, at least from the question asker perspective, even if there are upvoted answers. </p>  <p>If an user has an high acceptance rate (>80%, for instance) then it is expected that he accepts all questions except the ones that he considers not to have a valid answer. </p>  <p>Therefore, for these users, the unaccepted questions should be considered unanswered.</p>  <p>I'm not entering in details about the rules, it's just to give an idea and ask for your opinion.</p> 	New Careers feature "Passive Candidate Search" - feedback wanted!<p>We're launching a new, experimental feature tomorrow on Careers, and wanted to get people's opinion on it.</p>  <p>As always, our goal is to <strong>help awesome programmers find great jobs</strong>.  However, we've found that:</p>  <ol> <li>People don't always want to signal that they're looking for a job</li> <li>A lot of candidates don't even realize that there are better opportunities out there</li> <li>Creating a complete CV is a lot of work</li> </ol>  <p>So, what we want is a way for people to be "passively" looking for a job -- they're willing to get an occasional offer from a company, even if they're not actively looking for a job right now.  And we want it to be frictionless, because if somebody is passively looking for a job then by definition they're not going to do anything to seek it out.</p>  <p><strong>Enter "Passive Candidate Search"</strong></p>  <p>Passive candidate search is basically just a glorified version of the <a href="http://data.stackexchange.com/" rel="nofollow">Data Explorer</a>, but for employers.  It lets employers search people's public profiles based on <strong>tags</strong> and <strong>location</strong>.  For example, they could search "Python" and "San Francisco" and find a few dozen SO users who have "San Francisco" as their location and have answered questions in the Python tag.  They can view their <strong>public profile</strong> information, including their top answers.</p>  <p>If they find a candidate they really like, they can <strong>request to contact them</strong>.  Say I want to contact <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/6212/jason-punyon">Mr. Punyon</a> -- he'll get a message in his global inbox that says "David Fullerton wants to contact you on Stack Overflow Careers".  If he wants, he can block all future searches and messages and be done with it forever -- or he can view the message, and decide if he's interested or not.</p>  <p>We'll be closely monitoring how employers use this to make sure they don't just spam tons of people.  To start with, we're limiting them to <strong>20 open messages</strong> at a time.</p>  <p><strong>What They See</strong></p>  <p>Starting tomorrow, you can see exactly what employers will see by going to <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/cv/employerview">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/cv/employerview</a>.  You'll also be able to test-drive the search interface at <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/employer/candidate-search">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/employer/candidate-search</a> to get an idea of how they'll be searching.  To summarize it here, they'll see:</p>  <ul> <li>Your user name, location, and gravatar from your public profile</li> <li>Your reputation across all our sites</li> <li>Your top answers by score</li> </ul>  <p>In other words, what they'd see on your profile page on any of our sites.</p>  <p>You'll only rank for a tag search if you have at least <strong>5 upvotes in answers in that tag</strong>, and won't show up at all if there are no tags you have 5 upvotes in.</p>  <p><strong>Other Details</strong></p>  <ol> <li><p>We never reveal anything that's not already publicly available.  The only thing that couldn't already be done is sending someone a message, and we'll tightly control that.</p></li> <li><p>Messages will only show up in your global inbox -- you'll never get an email (or a phone call).</p></li> <li><p>Starting tomorrow, you can pre-emptively block all searches and messages by going to <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/cv/employerview">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/cv/employerview</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Viewing a message from an employer won't change how you appear in their searches -- you'll still show up as a "passive candidate" who probably isn't looking for a job right now.</p></li> <li><p>We geocode your location, so if you don't have a location or it's gibberish, you won't show up.</p></li> <li><p>Initially, we'll only include SO, but eventually we want to include other sites that make sense (SF, SU, gamedev, etc).</p></li> </ol>  <p>Once again, this is <strong>experimental</strong>.  If it's not working, we'll get rid of it.  Our goal is that if there happens to be an employer looking for someone awesome in your area, you'll get an occasional message asking if you're interested.</p> 
duplicate	Removing a comment and try to vote up another one in under 5 seconds<p>When i remove a comment of mine and after that directly try to upvote another one i receive the message, that a upvote for a comment is only possible every 5 seconds.</p>  <p>Is this a wanted behaviour?</p>  <p>This is reproducable. Try it yourself.</p> 	Deleting a comment (mine) shouldn't count as a comment vote<p>I had an old question that I revisited in order to link it in a new answer. I noticed that in the comments Steven A Lowe had a funny comment that I -- at the time -- had responded to with "why can't I upvote comments?"</p>  <p>Well, of course, now I can.  So, I voted Steven's comment up then went to delete mine. I got the warning box that I can only submit comment votes once every 5 seconds. This seems like a bug to me. Deleting is not the same as voting.</p>

non-duplicate	Interperating Question/Answer Data in Data Dump<p>I'm a college student working with a recent SO data dump to learn about database queries and eventually formally model a standard procedure for getting statistical data from causal questions on relational schema. Big words aside, there's a "Parent ID" associated with an Answer, and I wanted to clarify whether or not that pointed to the Question the Answer was answering. Thanks for the help!</p>  <p><em>Update</em> Here's the SO schema I've been working on, in the form of an Entity-Relationship diagram (all of this was translated from the readme.txt that came with a recent data dump):</p>  <p><img src="http://imgur.com/sbdpA.png" alt="alt text"></p>  <p>So to help clarify: - rectangles are entities - diamonds are relationships - triangles represent an ontology - ovals are attributes Any entity that had a foreign key to another entity, that foreign key gets absorbed in a relationship. Ex) "Earns" has an earns_id, a user_id, and a badge_id, so showing badge_id as an attribute of user isn't necessary (the same goes for user_id in badge). And, cardinality is indicated by the crows feet being many, and single line being one.</p>  <p>So theoretically, each entity and relationship would get its own table when translated to DB.</p>  <p>Let me know if you think I'm on the right track, or if something seems horribly wrong, I appreciate it!</p> 	Suggest edits to Company pages on Careers 2.0<p>Recently, I found some typos on a Company Page at Careers 2.0. I didn't find a nice, direct way to suggest the company to fix it.</p>  <p>I wonder if there is a way to suggest an edit to the company page, so the employer can accept, reject, or edit the page by itself. If this feature doesn't exist, I think it would be a nice one to be implemented.</p>  <p>Thanks</p> 
non-duplicate	"Top of page" link<p>As long as I am always annoyed by links sending to the top of the current page on most web sites, SO is one that could really use one. </p>  <p>I mean, after reading all questions on e.g. "interesting" tab, to do anything useful you need to go to top menu, which means lots of scrolling. Such link could be viable on question pages after answers, but this would probably need more consideration. Hope I am not the only one who feels this way.</p>  <p>Please post your opinion on this subject.</p> 	Update Reputation FAQ - Posting Images<p>This is pretty minor, but can we update the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/faq#reputation">reputation faq</a> to state that 10 rep is required to post an image in a question (and answer, I assume)?</p>  <p>I tried looking up the rep requirement for this privileged after reading <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/121106/question-asked-by-low-rep-user-another-user-added-images-op-cant-edit#comment320674_121106">this question</a> but it's not listed</p>

So, theoretically, I can clone the answer's reputation every time it get's migrated and undeleted. So, uh, how many times can a question be migrated? <code>&gt;:}</code></p>  <hr>  <p>When a question is migrated, all its answers get migrated with it (presumably). One thing I just noticed is the option to <code>undelete</code> my answer on the <code>?noredirect=1</code> landing page for the question (i.e. as it was before migration).</p>  <p>Why does it say that my answer is deleted as opposed to migrated? What happens if I undelete it? The <a href="http://superuser.com/faq#deletion">FAQ</a> does not explain answers being deleted due to migration.</p>  <hr>  <p>Example: <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/396949/how-to-group-all-emails-from-one-user-into-one-collection-in-gmail?noredirect=1">How to group all emails from one user into one collection in gmail?</a></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nyvtr.png" alt="migrated"></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Tfnvz.png" alt="undelete"></p>  <hr>  <blockquote>   <h2>Ok!

non-duplicate	How to follow or be aware of important meta topics and arguments<p>Many users on the main site, Stack&nbsp;Overflow, got great help by asking questions and receiving quality answers. In time, with increasing reputation, many of this <em>many</em> people develop their style in asking and answering. </p>  <p>Again, some of <em>these</em> people wish to do more, so they start to comment for new-comers and handle review questions. Users with higher reputation can access moderator tools. </p>  <p>So for those people who review, moderate and comment; meta is both a great and an important place. Since this is such a dynamic community, things got argued about and functionality got changed, or stayed the same for some more time. People who review and moderate (probably) check meta often. There are questions and answers about site moderation for <em>making this a better place</em>.</p>  <p>As I said, reviewers and editors and moderators visit here often. But for sure, there are times when these people can not login for a few days or weeks. Or new users do not know much about what have spoken before about edits, reviews and moderation.</p>  <p>My question is about that: Is there an easier way to keep track of these topics? Of course, there are lots of topics which are worth a gaze for its content. But I am talking about ones that affect the community itself. Like posts that causes something to change. Or a big argument about edits and some radical decisions about future edits.</p>  <p>Following are some examples about these topics:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/211080/173052">Improving “demonstrate a minimal understanding” close reason</a></li> <li><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/210840/173052">Should Stack Overflow be awarding “A”s for Effort?</a></li> <li><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/2950/173052">Should 'Hi', 'thanks,' taglines, and salutations be removed from posts?</a></li> </ul>  <p>These are examples that <em>come to my mind</em> as examples, but of course there are some more of these out there somewhere.</p>  <p>I did not see a general similarity that will help me to categorize them easily and recognize them with a glance. There isn't any common and separative tag that all of them had or they are not all community wiki.</p>  <p>Is there an easy way to separate them and reach them?</p>  <p>What I have in mind is a special tag with:</p>  <ol> <li>A different background color like the shiny brown backgrounded tags, but with a different background color.</li> <li>Tag will only be added or removed by moderators (guys with a ♦ sign in their profile names). So these posts can be flagged by them.</li> <li>Maybe a separate section where we can track them. Maybe a section in the help menu or a new tab under <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions">questions</a> tab with the same color of the related tag.</li> </ol>  <p>So we can keep track of such arguments or changes about the community moderation and behaviour. Also, new users can find and reach them more easily.</p>  <hr />  <p><strong>Update:</strong> As @Troyen mentioned in <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/215737/how-to-follow-important-meta-topics-and-arguments#comment697403_215739">this comment</a>. Let me explain it with an example.</p>  <p>If we consider <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/215220/173052">this great answer</a> of @jmac on <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/211080/173052">Improving “demonstrate a minimal understanding” close reason</a>, it <em>clearly</em> defines each closure reason. In fact, it is greater that the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/closed-questions">FAQ: Why are some questions marked "on hold"</a>. It defines each reason clearly. Reading that answer (in my whole opinion) will affect reviews! Instead of <em>"Your question do not fits, make it better"</em> type answers, maybe better comments will be written, like what is missing to make that question a better one. Or that answer will link, explaining what is missing in his question and how his question looks like to other users.</p>  <p>From that point of view, we can consider what @RobertHarvey said:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>However, can I humbly make the assertion that <strong>casual users of Stack Exchange sites should never have to visit Meta?</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>In my opinion; Yes! If such answers just stay on meta (except <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/featured" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;featured&#39;" rel="tag">featured</a> tag) and only meta users will know them (if they visit meta in time to see the question and those great answers). </p>  <p>Then just a tag is not enough maybe. Meta users should reach them easily, but the main site users are also to be aware of them as well. They read them or not, I can not say anything about that. But they should know that they exist, <em>those are like gems under the iceberg</em> for them. </p> 	Version Specific and Generalized Tags<p>Well, it seems as if there's no good way to put this (as this question <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/85358/how-to-use-version-specific-tags">has been asked before</a>, but ... from the other side of the hill, if that makes sense).  Basically, my question is not about tag creation, but about tag usage or even (god forbid, collective gasp) <strong><em>tag deletion</em></strong>.</p>  <p>Example comparisons: (delineated by spaces)</p>  <ul> <li>Flex Flex4 Flex-4 Flex-4.5 Flex4.5 Flex4.5.1 Adobe-Flex</li> <li>Adobe-Flashbuilder Flashbuilder flash-builder</li> </ul>  <p>Also consider this dilemma / example:</p>  <ul> <li>flash actionscript-3 flash-builder flashbuilder4 [aforementioned flex tags here] </li> </ul>  <p>I've found that the only way to get a question regarding Flex to be answered, is to tag it with the following:</p>  <p>Flex Flex4.5 f lash-builder [actual topic of question]</p>  <p><strong>Generally Accepted Problems</strong></p>  <ul> <li>Version Tags: <ul> <li>makes "favourite" and "ignored" tags almost useless.  Unless you only know a specific "version" of that programming language (?)</li> <li>gives the question significantly less exposure if the author (in the spirit of not duplicating tags) <strong>only</strong> uses the language specific tag.</li> </ul></li> </ul>  <p><strong>Possible Solutions</strong></p>  <p>Unfortunately, the only solution I can see at the moment is that if versions were (somehow) sub-tags of the actual language tags.  This solution would have serious implementation issues, but it's all I can think of.</p> 
non-duplicate	Too many pop-ups on mouse-hover<p>Different areas on a StackExchange websites are too sensitive to mouse-hover. They show some popups or other which is very annoying. Mouse pointer on tag shows a popup, Mouse pointer on the question shows a tooltip. Any given page is filled with tags &amp; questions. It becomes annoying when scrolling the page with the mouse wheel or middle-button automatic scrolling. It becomes hard to decide where to rest the mouse pointer so that no popup windows are shown.</p>  <p>Please improve on this. Reduce the frequency of popups by tweaking the UI.</p>  <p>Thanks.</p> 	Reopening feature requests with status declined<p>Sometimes I find interesting <a href="/questions/tagged/feature-request" class="post-tag required-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;feature-request&#39;" rel="tag">feature-request</a> which has <a href="/questions/tagged/status-declined" class="post-tag moderator-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;status-declined&#39;" rel="tag">status-declined</a>. However, I think that such feature should be implemented and it's possible that other community members also think that. How to handle that case?</p>  <p>I could upvote such question, but then, it wouldn't be clear which upvotes were made before declining the feature, and which after. </p>  <p>I could create new question with similar feature request, but it would be probably closed as duplicate.</p>  <p>I could post a comment that I don't agree with that decline and hope the folks thinking the same would upvote it.</p>  <p>What is the etiquete for showing disagreement with <a href="/questions/tagged/status-declined" class="post-tag moderator-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;status-declined&#39;" rel="tag">status-declined</a>? </p> 
duplicate	No option in 'flag -> close -> off-topic -> belongs elsewhere' for migrate to stats.SE<p>On Stack Overflow there a many questions pertaining to statistical software such as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r">R</a>.  Most of these questions are programming questions and undoubtedly belong on SO.  However, some questions are really about the underlying statistical ideas, and not about how to use R per se.  They belong on stats.SE (i.e., <a href="http://stats.stackexchange.com/">Cross Validated</a>).  However, when I flag such questions, CV is not listed with the other SE sites as an option.  <strong>Can we add CV to that list?</strong>  </p> 	When voting to migrate an off-topic question, why is the list of sites limited?<p>Earlier, I voted to close <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5055231/wordpress-downloadable-exes">this question about Wordpress</a> as off-topic.

duplicate	General Attitude: Stack Overflow: Non-constructive attitude, rather than constructive criticism<p>Is it just me, or is there a general non-constructive attitude, rather than constructive criticism on Stack Overflow?</p>  <ul> <li><p>I am having difficulty aligning my internal compass. I understand that certain questions need to be thrown out, and I understand that certain questions are fitting for certain Stack Exchange sites.</p></li> <li><p>I understand that the sites ore community moderated, and that a general "average" of community members' persona's will be reflected.</p></li> </ul>  <p>My issue is with the fact that, in my opinion, some users are a bit trigger happy with the down vote button, or are just downright rude, without providing any feedback to the user in question. </p>  <p>This is in my opinion much more non-constructive to the site than a Q that is slightly off topic, or not worded correctly. When did the down vote become a feel good weapon? I see this regularly where questions not deserving of down votes (in my opinion), get down voted by a what seems like a factor, because a trigger happy user down voted the Q, rather than tried to fix it. And now a bunch of users exercise their down vote button, because someone else did, and they can also do it.</p>  <p>I know we cant possibly moderate each down vote before it is applied, and I understand an "average" will be the outcome, but it seems like the good guys, interested in actually contributing in a constructive manner, are outweighed by the, in my opinion, non constructive guys. Its almost like the perceived anonymity of down voting, is being exploited. </p>  <p>I attempted to flag one such post, and the moderator replied with (We can't say why people vote the way they do). I understand that the community moderation is the power of these sites. But is it being abused?</p>  <p>Situations are created where legitimate questions, that may have been genuinely helpful to other users, are being "played" with by people exercising their privileges instead of their contribution.</p>  <p><em>(Again, the above all in my personal opinion)</em></p>  <p>From personal experience, I can attest to the fact that this behavior is demoralizing, to say the least. </p>  <p>I am personally trying hard to contribute. Not for rep, but to give something back as SO has really been helpful to me on multiple occasions.</p>  <p><strong>An example, but not specifically aimed at for the above, is provided in the link below this post.</strong></p>  <p><em>The original question, although broad, could be answered or "nudged in the right direction" in my personal opinion.</em> </p>  <p>The original question was aggressively acted upon, which I understand needs to happen in some cases. In this case, I feel the original poster, instead of being chased away with a broom, could have been pointed or helped, even if not on SO.</p>  <p>I indicated in a comment that this might have to be moved to a different site, like programming, if its not fitting for SO. I attempted to use the community wiki option, and created a new Q&amp;A, which I thought would go to the wiki, and not as a new question. I again, indicated that SO might not be the right place, and that I was making an "attempt" to contribute.</p>  <p>Instead of constructive behavior, I experienced more non constructive criticism, than what I would care for when trying to contribute.</p>  <p>As I said, maybe its just me. I guess my question revolves around determining if its just me seeing things.</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17947169/not-original-why-does-my-html-website-look-different-on-different-browsers">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17947169/not-original-why-does-my-html-website-look-different-on-different-browsers</a> (10k only)</p> 	Could we please be a bit nicer to new users?<p>There is a distinct decline in the level of civility here.  Some of this is due to new users coming in and posting spam and other nonsense, but the offtopic and downvote buttons are doing a pretty good job of keeping this under control.  </p>  <p>Unfortunately, a lot of this is coming from more experienced users, and the site's built-in moderation system is not (and probably cannot) handle this very well.  Folks are rushing to pound new users down with "this belongs on meta!", "this is off topic", "this is a duplicate!" and "read the FAQ!".  All this, of course, is accompanied by a flurry of downvotes.  This is not very welcoming to new users who don't know about meta, or what is offtopic, or the FAQ.</p>  <p>Now I am not proposing that we just allow offtopic, meta, or duplicate questions.  However, I think we could be gentler in the way we express these sorts of things.  Explain what meta and the FAQ are and provide useful links.  Just using please and thank-you when asking folks to read the FAQ or post something on meta would be an improvement.  I also think we could rein in the downvoting a bit.  Not that we shouldn't vote stuff down, but unless a new user's post is clearly spam, voting it down to -1 or -2 should be sufficient to send a message without piling on.  </p>  <p>I like Stack Overflow and I want it to become a resource for everyone, not just an elitist site for people who were in the private beta.</p> 
non-duplicate	Script to remove tags<p>There are some not useful or ambiguous tags which should be removed.

non-duplicate	Obnoxious down-voting?<blockquote>   <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>   <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/24826/max-downvotes-per-question-answer">Max downvotes per question/answer</a>  </p> </blockquote>  <p>I recently posted a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1765171/c-null-0x0-or-0/1765202#1765202">wrong answer</a>. This answer was accepted by the OP (thus making it indelible), and has, at this time, -7 votes. I got tired of losing rep, so I CW'd the answer.</p>  <p>But it got me thinking: what is the point of an answer which has less than -1 votes? </p>  <p>An answer with 0 votes could mean "highly controversial" (many up/down votes canceling), "neutral" (not a bad answer, but not great), or "not seen yet" (recently posted, not evaluated yet.)</p>  <p>But an answer of -1 means: "Wow. This was so bad and unhelpful that it needs to be marked as such. I trust the answerer a little bit less too, making them less reputable on the site." A negative vote-count is pretty bad and embarrassing.</p>  <p>Which leads to the question: what is the <em>point</em> of answers which are so heavily downvoted? It eventually gets really really rude and snippy. </p>  <p>Is it really <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1681180/homework-question-in-c">so</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1625281/how-to-make-a-tableless-table-with-help-of-css">bad</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/722983/how-much-time-is-too-long-to-develop-a-professional-website-closed">when</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1156363/create-a-compiler-for-windows">someone</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1209296/update-statement-throwing-an-error">asks</a> a poorly-conceived question because they misunderstand the website, assignment, or technology they want to use? (Case in point, there is a <em>huge</em> problem that clients complain that their website is "taking too long" to develop - so the vague question "How long should a website take to build?" is actually a very reasonable and relevant problem for a programmer to solve.)</p>  <p>Bad answers are far more dangerous: they propagate bad knowledge. While <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1631414/what-is-the-best-battleship-ai/1632147#1632147">this answer</a> is vastly unhelpful, -18 votes is only relevant to show that it is worse than a post with -17 votes, but really, once a post is negative, who cares? While I have no idea what the "JS" is in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1273713/what-ways-can-i-put-a-favicon-into-my-site/1273754#1273754">person's post</a>, half of the answer is pretty correct and reasonable. And I don't even know what the (downvoters'?) coments mean.</p>  <p>The only explanation I can think of is some sort of bandwagon effect. "Aargh, we'll show <em>them</em>! How dare they waste my time with such an <em>inane</em> response?" Its obnoxious and makes us look like twits.</p>  <p>So I can think of two solutions (if anyone else feels this strongly about this! Which is likely nobody, but hey.)</p>  <ol> <li><p>Cap the vote score to -1 or -2 or something. Just so everybody gets the point.</p></li> <li><p>Have increasing cost to the voter for negative downvotes. How about this: if <em>i</em> is the vote count after performing a downvote, and i &lt; 0, then the points lost could be expressed as:</p></li> </ol>  <p>n = abs(i)</p>  <p>points lost = 2^(n-1)</p>  <p>So the first negative vote would give -1 points to the voter. Then -2, -4, -8. So that, by the time the post has a vote count of -4... it stops becoming worthwhile to join that bandwagon. (one could also use fib(n), rather than 2^n).</p>  <p>Alternately, one could increase the rep requirement to downvote for very negative values of i. You need 1000 rep to vote something to -2, but then 1500 to vote it to -3.</p>  <p>Do others feel like this is a problem?</p> 	How Does the Community User Set Bounties?<p>I decided on poking around some profiles and I hit the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/-1/community">Community user</a>. I knew that Community was a background process but then I noticed that it had set some bounties. What criteria does Community follow to know what questions to set bounties on?

It can be problem book with answers, starting from simple questions to advanced concepts.</p>  <p>I know it is little too much of asking in a Q&amp;A site. But the truth is there are many people like me, who browse through SO to find good questions, techniques in language of our interest and learn concepts that way, this approach will make life easier for lot of us. If there is a proper mechanism/tool, people can compile a good collection of question through which one can learn language/technique.</p>  <p>What do you think?</p> 
duplicate	Migrate shortlist based on tags?<p>Would it be a good idea to change the migration destination sites based on the question tags?</p>  <p><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/67574/how-do-i-migrate-questions-the-option-to-migrate-questions-is-gone">The new migrate option</a> allows one to select from a limited number of destination sites. This group of sites is the same for a whole site, to keep the list short. However, if a question is tagged with <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wordpress" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;wordpress&#39;" rel="tag">wordpress</a>, it is likely that <a href="http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/">the WordPress SE site</a> would be a good destination.</p>  <p>What do you think of extending the destination list based on question tags? This would give smaller SE sites a chance of migration input, without polluting the list for all questions. So you still have three or four standard destinations, and then add tag-based destinations to the list.</p> 	Context sensitive "it doesn't belong here" options?<p>I've noticed that questions will come up that belong on another site within the stack exchange network, however the "it doesn't belong here" option only shows popular sites. </p>  <p>Is it possible to have a context sensitive flag box that reads the questions tags and provide the appropriate options to migrate the question?  </p>  <p>For instance, question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18217867/caught-exception-when-trying-to-configure-a-nicemenu-or-a-superfish">caught exception when trying to configure a nicemenu or a superfish</a></p>  <p>was flagged <code>drupal-7</code>,<code>drupal-modules</code> and <code>drupal-theming</code>, yet the option to migrate to the drupal SE site is not present: </p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tdOn8.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>Having context sensitive migration would allow the drupal site to appear in the selections.</p>  <p>I think this would be better than using the "needs moderator attention -> other" option, or flagging in another inappropriate way.  </p>

It turns out that I modified my question, another user also improved it a lot and it was reopened. </p>  <p>But I'm still amazed and disturbed by the fact that I cannot ask question like "What is the best...".</p>  <p>This type of question has some negatives:</p>  <ul> <li>Create emotional reactions</li> <li>Attracts spams</li> <li>Attracts non objective answers, sometimes by creators of products/software</li> <li>Could lead to inappropriate exchange/words</li> <li>Generate lots of unnecessary information</li> <li>It is subjective</li> </ul>  <p>But these kinds of questions also have their positives:</p>  <ul> <li>It create debate where lots of useful information came out</li> <li>Brings new information that could lead to change some minds / a new vision to readers</li> <li>In most case, those questions lead to a solution that will save a lot more time than any other kind of question</li> <li>In most case, those questions lead to a solution that will save a lot more of money than any other kind of question (usually related to products)</li> <li>Brings creator reaction that would bring additional useful information on the product, reason of certain design decision, ...</li> </ul>  <p>In summary:</p>  <p>Considering the negatives and the positives, and also considering that Stack Overflow has a really good system for rewarding/penalizing users, I think that the acceptance of this type of questions would be a lot more beneficial for users than anything else. It is only because Stack Overflow has this rewarding system that it could support those type of questions easily whithout too much drawbacks. Also, Stack Overflow has the best reputation and is recognized as the best question/answer system now for programmers (it is subjective I know, but don't be blind, be honest and admit it), then I think that it returns to Stack Exchange to offer that type of question for the benefits of everyone.</p>  <p>If Stack Overflow does not support this type of question, what can we do? Where can we go to have lots and good reactions to this type of questions? Who will do it?</p> 	Are the rules really so important that a useful question has to be deleted?<p>I needed to find a good Perl module to do HTML parsing.  The good thing about Perl is the CPAN (module library) with gazillions of modules to do everything, the bad thing is that it's hard to find the right module.</p>  <p>So I though, let's ask Stack Overflow: “What is a good Modern Perl way to parse HTML documents?”</p>  <p>I quickly got one great answer and several good comments.  I would have gotten at least one more good answer, but then the question was put on hold because it's “subjective”, and it couldn't be added anymore.  In spite of protests, it was then closed and later deleted.</p>  <p>I've got the answers that I needed, but now other people will be deprived of this useful information.  Is it really so important to stick to the rules that this question had to be removed? Yes, it's subjective.  By definition.  I want people's opinions about what module I should use, after all. The question got 8 plus-votes and 2 minus-votes, so others thought it was useful too.</p>  <p>The URL was <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17502435/what-is-a-good-modern-perl-way-to-parse-html-documents">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17502435/what-is-a-good-modern-perl-way-to-parse-html-documents</a> , but I think it only works when logged in as me.</p>  <p>Do I need to start looking for another site to ask such questions?  If so, too bad, I really liked Stack Overflow until now.</p>

duplicate	Which computer science / programming Stack Exchange do I post in?<p>There seems to be more than a few computer science/programming Stack Exchange networks (is that the correct term?).  Stack Overflow, being the first, has by far the most users, questions, and answers.</p>  <p>What is the reasoning for creating the others, and are there clear guidelines for which kinds of questions should be posted?  I can see a large amount of potential overflow, many cases of people not getting a good answer to their question because the person who has the answer isn't browsing that particular network at the moment.  I understand that they were probably created for organizational purposes, but wouldn't almost make more sense to just have them as categories under Stack Overflow, keep them separated but still connected, instead of making people have to create multiple 'account's, one for each network?</p>  <p>I am sure there was a very good reason to break them up, but as someone that is new to SE, it can be somewhat intimidating to decide which one to post in to ensure you get a good answer.  For example, If I am a Computer Science student, my first instinct might to be to post in the Computer Science network, until I see that it literally has 1% of the users as the Stack Overflow network, which still seems to be for programming/computer science related questions, so my second instinct would then to be to post it into the SO network on the basis that I have a significantly higher chance of my question being seen and getting a good answer with 100x the users.  Then I notice that there is also a 'programmers' network, and I don't even begin to know where that fits in.  I, and I am assuming most people, will probably just post in the SO network to be safe.</p>  <p>My question is, other then the short little description blurb of each one, is there a clear cut set of guidelines which what each network is intended for, what kinds of questions should go to each one, and is anything being done to encourage people to post in these newer, smaller (more specialized?) networks as opposed to just posting in big daddy Stack Overflow?  Now again, this is for computer science/programming/"why isn't this code doing what I want?" related questions, I am not saying that if I had a question about Linux or Wordpress or something I would have the same confusion. </p> 	Site recommendation: Stack Overflow or Computer Science.SE?<p>I am very confused about whether to post these types of question on Stack Overflow or Computer Science.SE.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3K2jr.png" alt="top"> <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xAyBK.png" alt="bottom"></p>  <p>I am aware Computer Science is in beta and would like to support it (constructively), I am also studying computer science. However, my questions are usually about coding specifics, but when it is about a programming principle, which site to I go to?</p> 
non-duplicate	Can I print a single answer?<p>After looking around on the page, I couldn't find any print link or anything that would indicate such functionality; but, I'm hoping a power user knows something that I don't.</p> 	Why so few algorithmic questions?<p>A mere observation (and please correct me if you feel otherwise) - </p>  <p>Stack Overflow has, by and far, a lot more technical questions than algorithmic questions.</p>  <p>Why is this? Maybe because most programmers' jobs today are to hack together different components, and not necessarily devise clever solutions which are based on algorithmic problems?</p>  <p>I somehow feel that in the past I had more knowledge to share on Stack Overflow, and nowadays many questions are in technical domains which I am not proficient in.</p>  <p>Do you share my thoughts, or am I totally off course?</p>

duplicate	Is there a sandbox to post test questions?<p>I have noticed a behaviour that may or may not be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" rel="nofollow">Markdown</a> bug. It is a discrepancy between the preview and the rendered result, which is why I would need to post a question to check it out.</p>  <p>Is there an official place to do that?</p> 	Is there a thread on this site where someone can practice mardown<p>I've been trying to use markdown in comments and they never come out right. </p>  <p>When starting a thread, the system show what the markdown will eventually produce before you submit it. That's great. Responding by adding a comment has no such preview facility and every time I hit the enter key to get to a new line (force of habit) it uploads an unfinished comment. That's rude.</p>  <p>I'd like to have a practice thread where anyone can just add comments. Is that asking too much?</p> 
non-duplicate	Include own answers in calculations<p>I have heard that my own answers are not included in my badge calculations?

So I created a localhost page with the forms of Stack Overflow, posted something and it worked.</p>  <p>So, why doesn't Stack Overflow use it?</p> 
non-duplicate	Suggested edits do not save in tag wiki edits<p>If you make a suggested edit to a question or an answer, and then you decide that it needs further editing, the edit box saves what you had already suggested, even if it hasn't been approved yet. That really helps.</p>  <p>However, after fat-fingering and having to submit a few replacement edits on English.SE, I realized that this doesn't happen for tag wikis. In other words, the edit box fails to retain your suggested edit and instead displays the pre-approval status of the change. Could we get the tag wiki editor to also retain suggested edits?</p>  <p>This, of course, doesn't affect other editors, since only the original editor is allowed to make a change while the suggested edit is sitting in the queue.</p> 	How about a "Vote not to close" option to counter the "Vote to close"?<p>My request is simple: Many times, there will be a question where some people feel like it should be closed. At the same time, I'll feel like it's a perfectly legit question, and it should therefore NOT be closed. Right now, I have to wait till it gets enough close votes (which it always does for some reason, as soon as 1 or 2 people vote to close, e/o else decides to vote as well) and then vote to re-open. How about, as soon as there's one vote to close, there should be an option to counter the close vote, something like "vote not to close" or whatever. This would then bring the "Vote to close" number down by one. Only when the vote to close outnumbers the vote not to close by 5, that's when a question is indeed closed. Any thoughts?</p> 
duplicate	No answers deserve bounty<p>I posted a question a few days ago which I assigned a bounty to. One of the answerers didn't seem to have basically any idea what he was talking about and the other misread the question, so neither of them was any help. But I have to award the bounty, even though I feel that neither of the answers posted by other people (I solved the problem myself) are useful.</p>  <p>Is there any way that I can choose to not award the bounty?</p> 	Explicit "do not award bounty" button<p>Shouldn't there be a way to prevent automatic awarding of a bounty? For example, if someone provides an answer that sounds good but is totally wrong, it may happen that it gets a score of +2, but doesn't deserve the bounty. If noone else answers, half the bounty will automatically go to this person. Automatic awarding is good if an inactive user offers a bounty, but I think there should be a button that basically means "I know the bounty should now be awarded, but I have read the answers and none of them deserve the bounty".</p>  <p>The button should obviously <strong>not</strong> refund the bounty, just let it go to /dev/null instead of awarding it to someone who doesn't deserve it.</p>

For one thing, it's annoying to have a stream of questions all bumped up to the top of the Active queue for over an hour, and the Suggested Edit queue has been sitting at 40+ items for the same time period, but is it really hurting anything either?</p> 	Limit the number of suggested edits that a user can make in a day<p>I'm throwing this feature request out in response to the following two questions.</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/116565">Too Minor rejection reason needs either to be reworded or removed</a></li> <li><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/116509">An alert to serial minor edits</a></li> </ul>  <p>The current system for suggested edits seems to work perfectly fine in all cases but one: when a user (or group of users) decides to search for possible typos and edit posts <em>en masse.</em> I entirely agree with <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/116574/162705">the following logic</a>.</p>  <blockquote>   <ul>   <li>I do not believe it is possible to fix all the issues that might exist in the posts this way.</li>   <li>If you don't have edit privileges, you're causing work for users. Now, nobody minds this, unless you're not fixing all the issues in a   post and it's clear there's no thought going into the process at all.</li>   <li>Editing bumps things to the SO home page. Again, nobody minds and this is by design, but if you're fixing one tiny issue, is that a   reason to bump 100 questions to the home page? I'd say if you're   fixing all the issues with a post - including flagging what should be   flagged, closing what should be closed etc - great. If you're not,   you're bumping a whole lot of stuff...</li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>There are a few more issues to consider, as well.</p>  <ul> <li>Even though a single user can (theoretically) suggest an unlimited number of edits, <em>reviewers are limited in the number of edits that they can accept or reject per day.</em></li> <li>Most behavior on the Stack Exchange network is rate-limited: why shouldn't suggested edits be, as well?</li> <li>A single user's suggested edits can take up a disproportionate amount of the reviewers' time.</li> </ul>  <p><strong>I therefore propose placing a limit on the rate of each user's suggested edits.</strong> There are a number of ways we could do this.</p>  <ol> <li>Limit the number of suggested edits per user per day—to approximately 100? This is a high enough threshold for any reasonable number of daily edits, and besides, after 100 suggested edits get approved there's no rep in it for the editor anyway.</li> <li>Limit the number of suggested edits per user per hour.</li> <li><strong>Limit the number of <em>outstanding</em> (unreviewed) edits per user at any given time.</strong></li> </ol>  <p>I personally like the last solution because it would encourage people to spend more time on each suggested edit and <em>it would optimize for the valuable resource that is being spent on each suggested edit: reviewers' time.</em></p>

The feed page has "hot" and "interesting" using half the real estate, except the interesting section has 5 sites that I do not use, I've only been to one of them once. But that's <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/220387/how-can-i-prevent-the-app-from-showing-interesting-questions-from-sites-i-don">a topic for another thread.</a></p>  <p>So I use two taps to scroll over to StackOverflow, where I actually want to be. Not too bad. This puts me on the "active" page, which has four questions in languages I don't know and am not interested in. Okay, this is how the website works anyway, no big deal.</p>  <ul> <li>Taps: 2. (Website clicks: 0) (3 and 1 if you count opening the app and clicking on a bookmark)</li> </ul>  <p>On the main site, my favorite tags are on the right sidebar, so I click one of them and now I have questions I want to read. Great. However, we're talking about the iOS App. So I click <strong>Tags</strong>, and am rewarded with a list of every tag on StackOverflow. </p>  <ul> <li>Taps: 3 (Website clicks: 1)</li> </ul>  <p>If I want a tag less popular than <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ruby" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ruby&#39;" rel="tag">ruby</a>, I have to wait for the page to load. Less popular than <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/multithreading" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;multithreading&#39;" rel="tag">multithreading</a>, I have to wait for it to load twice.

I'd rather use a bookmark and the mobile website skin.</p>  <p>How we can improve this:</p>  <ol> <li>Provide easy access to favorite tags when you first load a StackExchange site.</li> <li>Remove <strong>Users</strong> from the bottom scroll bar. I don't think I've ever clicked on it on the main site, and, honestly, how many times do I need to see that Jon Skeet has the most reputation on StackOverflow? <ul> <li>Instead, replace it with something like <strong>Favorites</strong></li> </ul></li> <li>When you click on a tag on the <strong>Tags</strong> page, the default sort should either be your most recently used sort, or at the very least <strong>Active</strong> or <strong>Newest</strong>.</li> </ol>

duplicate	Give less reputation on answers when question is marked as duplicate<p>We always come across questions that are duplicate. If a question already has comment that it is possible duplicate. Then, I always check if that is the correct duplicate and if yes, I flag it as duplicate. But I also see people posting same answers as earlier.</p>  <p>Those answers get upvotes and reputation, even though same answers are already posted in the other questions.</p>  <p>I suggest that after the question is marked duplicate (e.g. after second or third vote while question is still open) answers posted on that question will give less reputation to their author when voted up, e.g. 5 points instead of 10.</p> 	Give an incentive for finding duplicate questions<p>At present if you see a question that may be a duplicate and has an easy answer you can post the answers or post a link to the duplicate question.  (Or the few hi-rep users can vote to close it as duplicate, think of normal users here, not the people that read Meta)</p>  <p>It is better for Stack Overflow if a link to the duplicate is posted as a comment, or the user votes to close the question as a duplicate.  However, the user gets more rep if he/she posts the easy answer quickly.</p>  <p>I'm thinking of something along the lines of:</p>  <ul> <li><p>First person to post a comment that points to possible duplicate gets some rep if the question is closed as a duplicate and at least 2 of the other closers chose that same dupe question.</p></li> <li><p>Whenever someone votes to close as a duplicate, a “possible duplicate” comment should be posted with a link to the other question, if there is not already a link to it in a comments.  <em>(The system now does this)</em></p></li> </ul>  <hr>  <p>As Ether said,  The removal of reputation earned from answering a question that is later closed as a duplicate would at least remove the negative incentive, but is that enough to correct this behaviour?</p>  <p>Is a “duplicate finder” badge part of the solution?</p>  <ul> <li>A bronze badge for being the first person to vote to close a question as a duplicate with the same “duplicate of” question chosen as most closers choose.</li> <li>A silver badge for doing the same 25 times.  </li> </ul>  <p>See also <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/dr-strangedupe-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-duplication/">Dr. Strangedupe: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying And Love Duplication</a></p>  <p><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/77103/improve-tools-for-closing-as-duplicate">Improve tools for closing as duplicate</a>, would also help.</p>

I made it compile clean and (in my opinion) more readable.</p>  <p>The edit got rejected as too minor, because during my edit the OP made the code compile-clean in the grace period and thus in the diff that shows up to the reviewers, only the parts making the code more readable showed up. Such an edit is a too minor one, without question.</p>  <p>In my opinion there are two possibilities to solve this kind of "conflict":</p>  <ul> <li>When user A has edited a post and user B (>2k rep, or original author) has edited that post in the meantime user A gets a message that the post has changed and is asked to revise that edit based on the changes made in the meantime.</li> <li>The easier one: Don't allow edit suggestions in the grace period.</li> </ul>  <p>I don't care about the missing reputation I would have gotten if the suggestion had been approved. I just don't like my suggestions being reviewed on a false basis - because the diff that is displayed to the approvers does not display the correct edit.</p>  <p>Doing a quick search here on meta I found some questions maybe related to this problem - none of them however addresses the problem of the review based on incorrect diffs:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/100003/no-warning-when-op-edits-question-during-the-five-minute-grace-period">No warning when OP edits question during the five minute grace period</a></li> <li><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/45478/question-history-attributed-changes-to-me-that-i-didnt-make">Question history attributed changes to me that I didn't make</a></li> <li><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/128734/suggested-edit-after-a-retag-within-5-minute-grace-period">Suggested edit after a retag within 5 minute grace period</a></li> </ul> 	Possible bug with edit submission<p>I proposed an edit on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18240240/msaccess-minimize-the-toolbar-ribbon-onload">this question</a>, and my edit was rejected.</p>  <p>I'm not contesting the rejection, but something appears screwy.  When I first saw the question, there was no code formatting.  So I clicked "Edit", added the code formatting and clicked "Save Edits".  I got a message saying that my edit was less than six characters, so I made another slight change (added the second "I" in "I realize I can totally").  Hit "Save Edits" again and got the Thank You message.</p>  <p>Now, when I click on the "suggested edit" link for the question (in my Activity list), what appears for both the original text and my edited text are very different from what I saw when I made the the edit.  The original text has the code formatted, and my edited text includes a number of spelling and grammar changes that I did not make.

duplicate	How to generate stackexchange pictures with profile information?<p>Time ago I saw a profile with an image like this one:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2QkYT.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>So I copied the image url but adapting it to my own user id and I put it in my <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/230230/alter-lagos">profile</a> page.

non-duplicate	Removed comment activity upon deletion of answer<p>I wanted to go back to see if any further answers or comments had been posted on a Meta question which I had read through yesterday. I'd forgotten the title of the question and wasn't really sure what to search for as it related to the "Tags" on profiles. I assumed searching for "tags" would return too many results (and I wasn't sure when the question had originally been asked). I had however left a comment on one of the answers, so I figured the way to find the question would be to check my own <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/211113/james-donnelly?tab=activity&amp;sort=all">activity</a>, only to find that the comment was no longer listed.</p>  <p>In the end I did manage to find the question by searching for "tag": <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/178114/tag-scores-have-not-updated-script-did-not-run">Tag scores have not updated; script did not run</a></p>  <p>It turns out the comment I had left was on an answer which has since been deleted. This has meant that my activity log no longer shows this comment.</p>  <p>Would it not be sensible to keep the activity log but just mention that the content has since been removed? The comment itself doesn't even need to be shown, it could simply be displayed as:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8wafq.png" alt="Example"></p>  <p>This way users would be able to get back to questions they'd participated on through their activity log even if the answer had been removed.</p> 	"An error occured while loading"- what's that?<p>Today I can't open the inbox, or hot questions or notifications in any of the SE sites, I have tried it on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, but same error</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dC12S.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/m5G97.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

duplicate	When is it appropriate to edit someone else's code?<blockquote>   <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>   <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88627/how-far-can-i-refactor-someone-elses-code">How far can I refactor someone else&#39;s code?</a>  </p> </blockquote>    <p>I see a lot of edits in queue where some well-meaning user attempts to fix OP's code. They range from minor syntax corrections, to near total rewrites.</p>  <p>When is it appropriate to accept or reject these edits?</p>  <p>Here are my thoughts:</p>  <h3>On questions:</h3>  <ul> <li><strong>Never</strong> edit OP's code <strong>no matter how wrong it is</strong>, unless it is <em>strictly</em> to increase readability, and doesn't change how the code actually works. The very question itself might be solved by pointing out the error that you are fixing, no matter how small, so don't remove or correct it in the original post.</li> </ul>  <h3>On answers:</h3>  <ul> <li>Only edit code for <strong>obvious</strong> typos or mistakes by the author, do not attempt to "improve" the author's code. Even if the author is suggesting something stupid or dangerous, like forgetting to escape data for a database INSERT, it's better to leave a comment and let the author correct it. Downvote if applicable.</li> </ul>  <p>Editing the non-code parts of a post for grammar and the like are usually not going to change what the author intended to say very much, but code is taken <em>literally</em>, even a very minor edit will make a huge difference.</p>  <p>Am I close to the mark, or way off? Is there anything else to take into consideration? What are the exceptions, if any? I'm seeing a ton of these in the suggested edit queue.</p>  <p>When is it appropriate to edit someone else's code, and how should we deal with these suggestions from other users?</p>  <p>In addition (maybe a separate question), what can I do to help educate users who suggest unwelcome edits in general? Is there any way to leave them a comment so they can understand why the edit was rejected, so they don't continue to suggest <em>more</em> edits of a similar nature?*</p>  <p><sup>* An @ comment will notify the editor, this is clearly documented here: <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/43019/how-do-comment-replies-work/43020#43020">How do comment @replies work?</a> *</sup></p>  <p><sup>* However, it's not clear if @ replies ping the author of a <strong>rejected</strong> edit...</sup></p> 	Unable to improve answer because edit reviewers are rejecting for questionable reasons<p>I've always had a hard time getting reviewers to approve my edits pending peer review. It's very often either <em>"too trivial"</em> or <em>"too much change"</em>, with <em>"should be a comment"</em> thrown about here and there. <strong>How do I hit the silver lining?</strong></p>  <p>Just today, in this post, I thought I would improve the accepted answer by adding some useful information that would help the next person. In the process, I also decided to improve the formatting a little bit:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5845602/android-code-wont-generate-r-java-after-cleaing">Android code wont generate R.Java after cleaing</a></p>  <p>I suggested <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/2597601">this edit</a> first with the following comment:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>improved formatting, add footnote about errors that can be ignored</p> </blockquote>  <p>Within seconds it was rejected 3:1, so I thought I'll <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/2597652">try again</a>, this time with this comment:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>(why reject? I'm trying to add some useful information here so that the answer is more clear to someone who would encounter the same problem again. how is this edit "minor" or "trivial" or "not substantial"?) improved formatting, add footnote about errors that can be ignored</p> </blockquote>  <p>Again it was rejected 3:1, with one of the rejects explicitly saying "Should be a comment instead.". I would argue against this saying that making the extra information a comment would defeat the purpose of a website like StackOverflow, where seekers of answers should be given correct and <strong>complete</strong> answers.</p>  <p>In this specific case, the phrase <em>"Make sure you don't have any errors"</em> is misleading, because in the Eclipse IDE, even after other errors have been fixed, the error which I was talking about will still remain, which can only be fixed by doing the step that follows it ("Fix Project Properties") or the instructions in the second paragraph (modify XML file and save). This is what led me to suggest the edit to make the answer more complete and comprehensive, <strong>so the next person does not have to sift through the comments for such a valuable piece of information</strong>.</p>  <p>I think very often, peer reviewers at SO are rejecting suggested edits too harshly, too quickly and without fully understanding the original problem and the context in which the edits have been suggested. They seem quite often to follow a <em>gut feeling</em> when making decisions (<em>how can you reject an edit so quick within mere seconds of posting it?</em>) rather than analyzing the question/answer properly, understanding the context and thinking about whether the suggested edit is actually something worth keeping.</p>  <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong></p>  <p>I hope the SO/SU community can improve on the peer reviewing process so that actual useful edits are not lost in your battle against useless ones. Perhaps reviewers should be forced to spend some time reading the original question <strong>and</strong> the original answer, and deciding whether the edit adds valuable piece of information that could be helpful to the next person who has the same question. (This would mean edits can't be approved or rejected within seconds of viewing them, but the reviewer could be delayed by a minute or two* - I believe this will reduce the chance of <strong>impulse reviewing</strong> as the wait will encourage the reviewer to use the time productively.</p>  <p>* The time to wait could be tied to the caliber of the reviewer: a new reviewer could be given 3 minutes of wait; a learning reviewer 2.5 minutes; a <em>graduated</em> reviewer 2 minutes; a seasoned reviewer 1.5 minutes and a veteran reviewer 1 minute (the minimum wait for any reviewer).</p>  <p><strong>Alternative Suggestion (courtesy CodyGray and Mr.Wizard):</strong></p>  <p>The edit queue could be filtered based on tags of questions on which the edits were made, meshed with the top <em>five?</em> tags the user had been most active on (their past questions and answers combined, with answers bearing more weight and high-voted/accepted answers bearing even more weight). Those edits which had lapsed a couple of hours or a day without review could be placed in the unfiltered queue for anyone with enough reputation points to review them even if their top tags do not match the tags in the question. Both the filtered and unfiltered queues should be made available to the users with enough rep to see the review queues, without any specific restriction towards one or the other.</p>

non-duplicate	Need a new "award" bounty<h3>Problem:</h3>  <p>Now that subsequent bounties on a given question have to be greater than the previous bounty, there is no way to reward multiple good answers that weren't chosen as the accepted answer, but may still deserve an additional reward above and beyond the upvote.</p>  <p>Whenever we field a question on Meta about how to reward other good answers we point to the bounty system as the best method to do so.  That is no longer available for this use case.</p>  <h3>Process to duplicate:</h3>  <ol> <li>Post question</li> <li>Receive several very good, helpful answers, upvote them</li> <li>Select one as "accepted"</li> <li>Feel bad you can't also "accept" other great answers with the additional accept reward</li> <li>Set 50 point bounty to reward one answer</li> <li>Find out you can't set another 50 point bounty - it has to be 100 or greater</li> </ol>  <h3>Root cause:</h3>  <p>In order to avoid abuse of the bounty system by allowing people to repeatedly post 50 point bounties, each subsequent bounty must be at least twice the value of the most recent bounty:</p>  <p><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/64824/clever-bounty-reputation-hack/64826#64826">Clever bounty reputation hack</a></p>  <h3>Solution:</h3>  <p>Allow the OP to award 15 of their rep instantly to any answer on their question that hasn't already been given this award.  This is the same amount as an accepted answer, and doesn't fully involve the bounty system - no delay, no bump, no featured tab, etc.</p>  <h3>Implementation:</h3>  <p>While there are a number of ways to implement this in the UI, the one that makes the most sense is to add a button in the <code>start a bounty</code> box, "Reward other good answers" that enables a <code>+15</code> link that looks like a bounty reward next to each post.  Click the ones you want to give your 15 rep awards to.  They would look like rewarded bounties to others viewing the page so others can see you valued the additional insight they provided.</p>  <p>The reward would be stored in the system as a bounty, but if the OP went back to the page they would have to click "Reward other good answers" again to reward other answers - the +15 reward links wouldn't re-appear, so the DB doesn't need to store state.</p>  <p>Since other bounties can't be awarded in 15 point increments, then the check to see if a +15 has already been awarded can be done on the fly without storing any additional flags in the DB.  Just see if there's a +15 bounty already awarded, and disallow the OP from adding another +15 if they select "Reward other good answers" again.</p>  <p>We would have to allow them to award this to the accepted answer as well, otherwise it entangles the bounty system with the accept system again, which would simply be annoying to deal with.  If people want to double award the accepted answer, I don't see a reason to stop them, and it would avoid the issue of awarding them, then accepting the answer giving a different result than accepting the answer, then being unable to reward them.</p>  <p>We might want to consider disabling this link until they have accepted an answer.  If none of the answers are acceptable, they shouldn't be giving the same "accept" bonus to any answer.  A little more complex, but seems to be in keeping with the intent of this particular feature.</p>  <h3>Abuse:</h3>  <p>It doesn't really provide any new path for abuse that isn't already provided by bounties.  The only main difference is that it doesn't have a two day delay before it can be awarded, but since the purpose is not to attract new answers, but to reward existing ones, then I don't think that's an issue, especially given the low point value.</p>  <p>I don't think people will annoy OP for this additional bounty any more than they already do to accept an answer or place a bounty.

non-duplicate	Is there a Meta-site for Stack Exchange?<p>There is a meta-site for every Stack Exchange site but is there a general Stack Exchange meta-site where we can talk about the Stack Exchange model?</p> 	Where can one find the total number of unique users in the entire Stack Exchange network?<p>I've looked on the <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">Stack Exchange site</a> and the <a href="http://data.stackexchange.com/" rel="nofollow">Data Explorer</a>, and I can't seem to find the number of unique users on the entire stack exchange system.

non-duplicate	Can a Brother Get Some More Flags, Please?<p>I use up all my flags every day and my close votes. </p>  <p>For a super flagger and closer like myself, it would be nice if the system could somehow recognize this and give me more flags to use. </p>  <p>As a 10K+ user, there are plenty of opportunities for me to help clean up the morass.

duplicate	Which computer science / programming Stack Exchange do I post in?<p>There seems to be more than a few computer science/programming Stack Exchange networks (is that the correct term?).  Stack Overflow, being the first, has by far the most users, questions, and answers.</p>  <p>What is the reasoning for creating the others, and are there clear guidelines for which kinds of questions should be posted?  I can see a large amount of potential overflow, many cases of people not getting a good answer to their question because the person who has the answer isn't browsing that particular network at the moment.  I understand that they were probably created for organizational purposes, but wouldn't almost make more sense to just have them as categories under Stack Overflow, keep them separated but still connected, instead of making people have to create multiple 'account's, one for each network?</p>  <p>I am sure there was a very good reason to break them up, but as someone that is new to SE, it can be somewhat intimidating to decide which one to post in to ensure you get a good answer.  For example, If I am a Computer Science student, my first instinct might to be to post in the Computer Science network, until I see that it literally has 1% of the users as the Stack Overflow network, which still seems to be for programming/computer science related questions, so my second instinct would then to be to post it into the SO network on the basis that I have a significantly higher chance of my question being seen and getting a good answer with 100x the users.  Then I notice that there is also a 'programmers' network, and I don't even begin to know where that fits in.  I, and I am assuming most people, will probably just post in the SO network to be safe.</p>  <p>My question is, other then the short little description blurb of each one, is there a clear cut set of guidelines which what each network is intended for, what kinds of questions should go to each one, and is anything being done to encourage people to post in these newer, smaller (more specialized?) networks as opposed to just posting in big daddy Stack Overflow?  Now again, this is for computer science/programming/"why isn't this code doing what I want?" related questions, I am not saying that if I had a question about Linux or Wordpress or something I would have the same confusion. </p> 	Where should I post question about authenticating users?<p>I want to ask a question about authenticating users, specifically validating that an individual is an employee at one of a large number of companies (probably using their company's email address, which I don't know before hand).

non-duplicate	account still being banned...after improvements being made<p>My account, some weeks ago was banned due to bad posts/questions quality.

If the dedication of a bit more real estate is seen as pleasing, I'd say display ten of each.</p>  <p>This gives all badges a chance to hit the homepage, and we no longer have the more significant badges being quickly chased off by their inferiors (especially gold badges, which deserve to hold a place of honor for a bit longer than they do on any of the sites).</p> 
duplicate	Cancel misclicked flags<p>I'm wondering (since it just happened to me), is it possible to "cancel" ("undo", "delete", whatever) a flag I just raised if I misclicked it, so the mods won't waste time?</p>  <p>I looked everywhere, but I can't find such a feature.</p> 	Add the possibility to cancel created flags that are still active<p>I accidentally created a flag as duplicate for this question:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18039488/how-to-structure-modules">How to structure modules?</a></p>  <p>I was in the input to select a duplicate. Typed some words and pressed enter. It automatically selected the first entry. It didn't ask me anything and created the flag.</p>  <p>That said, I believe it could be good to be able to cancel our own flags. I see it as active in when I click the flags I created but there is no way to remove it. As I see it, it should be possible to remove our own flags as long as they are active. When the flag get rejected or accepted, it should not be possible to cancel it.</p>  <p>One other way to handle flags could be to show a flash popup just after a flag has been created with a link to cancel it. If you let the flash message go away, then it won't be possible to cancel it or you'll have to go in your profile to remove (it if such feature could be added).</p>

In both cases the person probably wasn't able to upvote since they were new, but they could have accepted my answer.  I felt a little guilty asking them to accept the answer, but since it solved their problem I felt that it would help others who stumbled on the question trying to solve their own problem to know that my solution really was the answer.</p>  <p>Is asking the OP to accept your answer when they've said that it solved their problem a reasonable thing to do or does it smack of reputation whoring?</p>

If there are flags for me to review, the counter will typically show more than those, and very often I will be unable to see any flags at all:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4cVO8.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>This has come up before in <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/187231/184688">this MSO answer</a>, but the <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/187216/184688">question it appears in</a> seems to describe a different bug (the counter dis- and re-appearing over time) which was <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/187957/184688">addressed</a> and marked <a href="/questions/tagged/status-completed" class="post-tag moderator-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;status-completed&#39;" rel="tag">status-completed</a> by Jarrod Dixon ♦.  I raised this issue as a <a href="/questions/tagged/bug" class="post-tag required-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;bug&#39;" rel="tag">bug</a> in the Physics meta, and <a href="http://meta.physics.stackexchange.com/a/4935/8563">Oded ♦ gave an explanation for that behaviour</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>One you have flagged, but so have others - you are seeing the count of others on it, but you can't see it because you have flagged it.</p>      <p>The second one also has a couple of flags on it, but one of those is a moderator flag. The count includes the non-moderator flag, but the moderator flag prevents you from seeing the post.</p>      <p>So... the count is that of current non-moderator flags (minus yours), the posts don't show up in your list for two different reasons.</p> </blockquote>  <p>EDIT: On second thought, this may not be quite as simple. The flag count I see sometimes depends on what tab I'm in. At the moment I see the counter at 4 when I'm in the <code>stats</code> through <code>delete</code> tabs, and it goes down to 3 in the <code>flags</code> tab (with no flags shown, as in the image above).</p>  <hr>  <p>I contend that this is a design flaw: <strong>that counter should show the number of posts (or flags) I can and should help out with.</strong> There is no reason for me to know that there are posts with moderator flags on them, and it is redundant to show me posts I have already flagged. That counter is prominently visible across all of the 10k tools so that I will go to that page when there's flags I should be handling. Having a nonzero value when there's nothing I can see makes me have to go to the <code>flags</code> page to check whether there's anything, and <em>completely invalidates the purpose of the counter</em>.</p>  <p>Also, while I'm at this, can the flags page say something like <code>There are currently no flags for you to review</code>, much like the review queues currently do, when there are no flags there?</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/z1psh.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>It is a bit unnerving to have a blank screen there.</p> 	Deleting questions older than 60 days<p>I have known that any question older than 60 days cannot be migrated, but closed by the moderator.<br> Can I flag to delete a question order than 60 days ? Can the moderator delete it?</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong><br> In a Stack Exchange site, I flagged an old question to delete. But the moderator misunderstood and down-voted and closed the question. I did leave a comment "TO DELETE".<br> Can the closed question be deleted by the moderator?  Is there a significant way to flag to delete a question so that it might not confuse with migration or close?  </p>

non-duplicate	Notifications when somebody edits a post that you've commented on<p>If person A writes a post, person B makes a comment asking for a clarification, and somebody (could be person A but could be person C) edits the post, shouldn't person B be given a note that the post was edited?  </p>  <p>I see this pattern pretty often where someone asks for a clarification but doesn't show up after the post is edited. Some people proactively send comments that @-message those commentators but I wonder if it should be done automatically.</p> 	Comment edit area very small<p>Why is the comment area for typing text so small ? Often I find myself squinting as I type a comment. Can it be increased in size, to at least the size of the max amount of comment characters ? Note, I just find this problematic when trying to scroll comment box, especially when attempting to check the readability of a comment prior to posting. Might be nice if there was a preview feature as a comment was typed....</p>

non-duplicate	Provide a more complete dump for failed sites<p>Given that all data on such sites will no longer be public, they generally have less of it and it would only need to be done once for each site, I think they should have more complete dump including for example:</p>  <ul> <li>Markdown source</li> <li>Revisions</li> <li>Anonymised deleted posts?</li> </ul> 	acceptance of answer doesn't give points<p>not so important, but an answer I gave was accepted today on StackOverflow.com without giving reputation points.

non-duplicate	Post edited while I'm working on my edit - closing the popup<p>Occasionally, while I edit a post, a popup along the top of the screen comes up indicating that another user has already edited this post and that my edit will only be accepted if it is more substantial than the previous one.  Fair game.  However when I submit my edit - and it is more substantial than the previous one - the edit is accepted and the post shows my edits.  Yet the popup along the top of the screen remains.  I would expect it to close automatically if I satisfied the requirement and it's no longer applicable.</p> 	Open an advertisement in a new page when it is clicked<p>Currently, we need to use the back button to return to a question after clicking on an advertisement.</p>

There were two "Approve" marks, but then <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/-1/community"><em>Community</em></a> rejected it, and that was it. The suggestion was rejected with a <em>1-2</em> reject-approve ratio.</p>  <p>From <em>Community</em>'s <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/-1/community">user page</a>, it states that "[it is] not really a person," and is actually "a background process" that does the following:</p>  <ul> <li>Randomly poke old unanswered questions every hour so they get some attention</li> <li>Own community questions and answers so nobody gets unnecessary reputation from them</li> <li>Own downvotes on spam/evil posts that get permanently deleted</li> <li>Own suggested edits from anonymous users</li> </ul>  <p>None of those mention that it works the review queue. In addition, the right side of the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/">review overview page</a> states that "Stack Overflow is moderated by [<a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"><strong>us</strong></a>]" - <em><strong>NOT</strong></em> an automated bot.</p>  <p>If the automated bot can do review on its own, why would we be reviewing manually?</p>  <hr>  <p>So, all together, I have a few small questions:</p>  <ol> <li>Is the ability to make an decision on behalf of everyone moderator-only or Community-only?</li> <li>Why is a computer allowed to make decisions for us?</li> <li>Why does <em>Community</em>'s <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/-1/community">user page</a> not mention that it can do that?</li> <li>Is <em>Community</em> really <em>only</em> software, or is there some interaction behind the scenes?</li> </ol>

This represents a question that is commonly asked yet nobody seems to know (or at least has contributed) the answer for. I have moved past the issue and am not interested in putting up a bounty. Nevertheless many people are interested in a solution to the problem (as reflected in the number of times it has been viewed.)</p>  <p>In the spirit of the Trilogy sites being a breeding ground for solid answers to interesting questions, what can be done to promote questions of this category? Perhaps some kind of auto-bounty system? What about 50 rep - something small yet enough to kindle some kind of interest in an answer?</p> 	I finally found the answer to my bounty question from months ago, now what?<p>I finally have the answer to my bounty question from last year.

The author of both questions deleted the earlier one, and now the later question has gone from two close votes to zero. This makes a certain amount of sense (it's no longer a duplicate), but I can't cast another vote even though my original vote is gone. This is troubling for a few reasons:</p>  <ul> <li>The original post was closed as off-topic; I can no longer cast a close vote against the new post as off-topic, even though it's a duplicate of an off-topic question (my close vote is effectively lost)</li> <li>Users can abuse this to swallow a certain number of close votes while spamming the same question into the system (as has just unintentionally happened with the above two questions)</li> </ul>  <p>Is this a feature or a bug?

Unfortunately, he then proceeded to delete the question I just cleaned up. Annoyed, I told him he shouldn't have done that. And as a result he seems to have undeleted the original. </p>  <p>Now it does seem that the close votes have been reset. Either that, or I no longer have an indicator that the question currently has a close vote. Trying to vote once again shows me I can't do so because I already voted on the question. </p>  <p>Is this expected behaviour? Or are we dealing with a bug here? </p>

duplicate	double confirmation for deleting?<p>Recently I received the "Tenacious" badge and noticed lots of answers I have posted had received 0 votes. So I started from the oldest ones and worked my way to the recent ones, deleting the bad and/or somewhat worthless posts on my mobile.</p>  <p>Every time I clicked the "Delete" link, I had to confirm <strong>twice</strong>. Bug or feature?</p>  <p>(Samsung Galaxy S III on Android 4.1.2)</p> 	Yes, I'm really sure I want to delete that post<p>Attempting to delete questions on the mobile site on iOS causes two notification messages asking me to confirm the deletion, which it shouldn't do.</p>  <p><del>I haven't really looked into it, but it may just be that</del> the handlers from full.js and mobile.js are both being triggered, as there seems to be the flash of the error dialog indicating something went wrong on the supposed second AJAX request when the response from the first triggers a page reload.</p>  <p>You can see this happening by following the method calls; the mobile view first calls </p>  <pre><code>StackExchange.question.init() -&gt; StackExchange.question.fullInit()   -&gt; StackExchange.vote.init()     -&gt; u()  </code></pre>  <p>...where <code>u()</code> sets a delegated click handler on</p>  <pre><code>$("div.post-menu *[id^='delete-post-'], table.flagged-posts *[id^='delete-post-']") </code></pre>  <p>...that calls <code>.preventDefault()</code> on the event, but doesn't block other handlers from firing.</p>  <p>It then later calls <code>StackExchange.mobile.init()</code>, which in turn calls the method <code>J()</code> that sets up a similar handler directly on <code>$(".delete-post")</code>.</p>  <p>Since both handlers get triggered, there's two confirmation dialogs, and two attempts to delete the post. The extra handler in mobile.js seems unnecessary, so just removing it would appear to be the easy fix to the problem.</p> 
duplicate	Granted privileges without reputation<p>Today I noticed in my inbox that I had been granted several privileges, for which I don't have the reputation necessary.  I still can't perform the functions allowed by the privileges, and my reputation has not increased.  I have a feeling this may be a bug, but I'm not sure.

Or am I just confused?<p>On the main Stack Overflow site, I arrived and had a banner: "Congrats, you've gained the privilege – create wiki posts and 3 other privileges" This confuses me, because I only see two privileges listed at 100%.

non-duplicate	How do I get notification for my own questions here?<p>How do I get notifications when someone answers or comments on my question here?</p> 	Provide a bronze badge for deleting one's own old comment<p>We have an enormous number of bronze badges on StackOverflow to help new users learn the basic functionality of the site. I propose a bronze badge for deleting a dated comment one has left:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Deleted your own comment which was at least 15 days old.</p> </blockquote>  <p>This does several things:</p>  <ul> <li>It adds badge consistency.</li> <li>It's a basic and relevant feature of the site which new users should know about. </li> <li>It indicates to users that deleting irrelevant comments is not only accepted, but <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/180325/help-us-figure-out-a-way-to-handle-the-explosion-of-comments-on-stack-overflow">generally requested</a>.</li> </ul>  <p>Since many of the basic functionality bronze badges are about teaching new users basic site use, it seems useful to point out the ability to delete comments.

duplicate	STOP! Look and Listen<p>Whenever I review Close Votes, I sometimes stumble upon something that I don't think should be closed, but just to make sure I haven't missed something, I press the "Close" button to see how many people have actually voted that something is e.g. off-topic or what is going on.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, this method is faulty, because from time to time I'll be met with this message which I'm sure we're all familiar with.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JGoTd.png" alt="STOP! Look and Listen"></p>  <p>And all of a sudden, I feel bad and feel like I've done something wrong, even though I haven't actually voted to close anything, I just wanted to peak.</p>  <p>Therefore, I have a question and a request:</p>  <p><strong>Question:</strong> Are those times where I apparently <em>don't pass the test</em> getting recorded? If I keep using this method, will it eventually have some effect on my voting?</p>  <p><strong>Request:</strong> Can we not make the error message show up until reviewers have clicked "Vote to close"? In the dialog, it shows many people have voted. Just adding random votes in here will only further my confusion to the close reason, but not having any votes in there will also be "suspicious". Exactly how this can be changed, I don't know; I just know that I don't like getting told to stop and listen for no reason...sob.</p> 	Close vote review audit flawed - fails without casting vote<p>Having just <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/close/2085329">failed my first review audit</a> from any of the queues, it was reviewing close votes; however, this audit was flawed in that I didn't even cast a close vote.</p>  <p>Often I press the <em>Close</em> button to preview greater detail and sentiment of the closure, spawning the <em>Why should this question be closed</em> dialog box:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2ML9z.png" alt="why-should-this-be-closed"></p>  <p>Especially for duplicates, where functionality is solely dependent on spawning this dialog.</p>  <p>From <em>Closing > Duplicate</em>, I can search or view selected duplicates:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QQ3VL.png" alt="duplicates"></p>  <p>Although, I realize general closure reasons are summarized on the page:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HsBTT.png" alt="summary"></p>  <p>This question had 6-upvotes, but seemed very localized referencing subjective query is "taking too long" and even had a sqlfiddle link.  Maybe overly broad regarding performance tuning, the OP was posting like a forum with two answer posts to his own question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/15978448/798448">here</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/15961025/798448">here</a> with one of those answers asking follow-up questions.  </p>  <p>Wanting to gauge community response, current closure totals struck my curiosity.</p>  <p>So, I pressed the <em>Close</em> button and boom - oh, the humanity!  I failed, and didn't even cast a close vote.  </p>  <p>Votes are not cast until a reason for closure is selected and <em>Vote to Close</em> is pressed.</p>  <p>Taking any review very seriously on this site, it only seems fair that my review quality is tested through actionable steps instead of clicking for more detailed information, leveraging the functional design of the close vote user interface.</p>  <p>Sure, it's complex to seed fake vote totals, and then there's controversy of mindless voting in the majority or people who simply cherry pick 4-vote questions.</p>  <p>Still though, it seems unfair I should hesitate to review further information of vote totals and duplicates before skipping due to the implementation of this audit.</p> 
non-duplicate	Answering tumbleweed questions - a proposal for attention<h2>Premise</h2>  <p>There are over 40k tumbleweed badge-giving questions now on SO (41,959 on last check), out of 186,432 unanswered questions. <a href="http://odata.stackexchange.com/" rel="nofollow">SEDE</a> (although a bit dated) lists 974,000 questions asked, so that's almost 20% of questions unanswered, and 4% doing worse than unanswered: they got ignored. The nature of the tumbleweed badge being that it is awarded once, there are potentially more than 4% of questions that go ignored.</p>  <p>Maybe we're growing beyond what the system as designed can handle. Lots of these tumbleweeds are from 1 rep users, and I'm betting that's turning off a lot of potential answers. Still, there's a growing (is it also growing proportion-wise?) pool of unanswered questions that are getting no attention.</p>  <h2>Proposal</h2>  <p>To up the value of answering tumbleweed (or tumbleweed-worthy) questions. When a question has the criteria for the tumbleweed badge (low views, 0 votes, 0 answers):</p>  <ul> <li>Upvote on answer give more rep (15 instead of 10), until there's an accepted answer</li> <li>Accepted answer gets more rep (30 instead of 15)</li> </ul>  <h2>Closing arguments</h2>  <p>Some suggestions have already been made in the past (for example <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/41410/have-unanswered-questions-receive-an-auto-rep-bounty-the-longer-it-stays-unanswer">auto-rep bounty</a>) which would arguably be gamed for maximum profit, which would have all sorts of perverse effects. Likewise if we had an answer reward proportional to question upvotes. These are out of the question. But to <em>force</em> a question to tumbleweed so it can be worth more to answer it? I don't know how that would get done. Just looking at the question to see if it's content is tumbleweed-worthy is bringing it closer to not getting tumbleweed.</p>  <p>I believe we can up the incentive on the forgotten questions and produce a lot more satisfaction for users everywhere. (And none of my questions ever tumbleweeded, so I'm not doing this for me :P)</p> 	Any details about stack.imgur.com?<p>Since May 2011, images uploaded through SE sites are uploaded to <a href="http://stack.imgur.com/" rel="nofollow"><code>stack.imgur.com</code></a>.

duplicate	Question tag score and suggesting tag synonyms?<p>On the <a href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/">Travel SE</a> (currently in beta), in order to be able to propose a tag synonym you need:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>more than 1250 reputation and a total answer score of 5 or more on the tag</p> </blockquote>  <p>What about people with a high question score on a tag, shouldn't we be able to suggest them to? For the tag I was planning to suggest a synonym for, I currently have a total question score of 17, but I'm not allowed to suggest them as I've not got the answer score. Would it not make sense to say require an answer score of 5, or a question score of perhaps 10? (Or maybe even 5, but given that question score doesn't currently count perhaps the bar needs to be set higher)</p> 	Allow Question Votes to count for tag synonym suggestions<p><em>NOTE: <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/103211/16241">Can we allow 7.5K users  to suggest tag synonyms without a score of 5 in the tag?</a> is a request for total rep to unlock synonym suggesting.</em>  </p>  <p><strong><em>This is not the same feature request.</strong>  This is a request to have Question Votes count toward the synonym suggestion total (rather than just answer votes).</em> </p>  <p>I ask a lot of questions.  Like any good question asker, I research my question before asking it.  (However, I don't so so much research that I am ready to jump in and start answering questions.)  </p>  <p>When I finally get around to asking my question, I frequently note that the phrase that is most commonly used to refer to a topic is not a tag.  After some searching, I find the right tag and I think "I would like to help out the next asker by putting a synonym on this tag".  </p>  <p>But even if my questions get some up-votes, I can't help out like this.</p>  <p>It seems a bit backwards to me to have the answerers being the only ones who can suggest synonyms.  The anwerers KNOW their tag(s).  They don't need any synonyms (so they are less likely to suggest them).</p>  <p>It is the question asker that needs the synonym (so that they can get their question on the right tag).  Because the asker needs the synonym, they are the most likely to identify a missing one.</p>  <p>So, I would like to suggest this feature request:</p>  <ul> <li>Allow askers with X number of question up-votes in a tag (or just # of questions asked) to SUGGEST synonyms.  </li> <li>Don't allow them to vote on synonyms, because they are not the authority (like the answerers are).</li> </ul>

duplicate	Make [webstart] a synonym of [java-web-start]<p>First off, I know that this question could be considered a duplicate of <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/137926/">this one</a>, but see what I'm about to tell you. I know that <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/java-web-start" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;java-web-start&#39;" rel="tag">java-web-start</a> has already been proposed as a synonym for <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/jnlp" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;jnlp&#39;" rel="tag">jnlp</a>, which it shouldn't be, because JNLP, or Java Network Launch Protocol, is the  protocol used BY Java Web Start to operate. Now, these questions have been largely unnoticed, with the moderators simply commenting that they can't, because of the synonym problem. In my opinion, the moderator should have:</p>  <ol> <li>looked at the definitions of <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/java-web-start" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;java-web-start&#39;" rel="tag">java-web-start</a> and <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/jnlp" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;jnlp&#39;" rel="tag">jnlp</a> and seen that the synonym proposal was incorrect,</li> <li>rejected the proposal to make it so that other tags can be synonyms of <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/java-web-start" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;java-web-start&#39;" rel="tag">java-web-start</a>, and</li> <li>proposed <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/webstart" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;webstart&#39;" rel="tag">webstart</a> to be a synonym of <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/java-web-start" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;java-web-start&#39;" rel="tag">java-web-start</a></li> </ol>  <p>However, none of these actions were taken, and I feel that moderators seem to be simply not doing anything about them (by that, I mean not even marking it as <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/status-declined" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;status-declined&#39;" rel="tag">status-declined</a>).

duplicate	Propose a privilege to sit in the 500 reputation mark<p>As <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/182586/do-we-still-need-the-retag-privilege">determined from earlier discussions</a>, the retag privilege serves a lot more confusion and a lot less of its benefit due to the suggested edit system. It must be done away with. It <em>will</em> be done away with. ♪</p>  <p>In light of this decided course of action, we're going to need a new snack for the road between "Create Tags" at 300 reputation and "Established User" at 1000 reputation. We'd like your help in thinking about some ideas on what would be a nice privilege to sit at this level. Since we're... a bit dry on our end.</p>  <p>The primary guideline in deciding what kind of privilege to put here is acknowledging its position in the overall hierarchy of privileges. 500 reputation is an early-intermediate user, one who has started to really get the hang of the site and its function. It can be something that provides convenience in how they currently can act on the site, or it could be some new functionality that fits as an early ability (especially considering there's no new abilities until 2000 reputation's "Edit Everywhat" ability).</p>  <p>I look forward to hearing what creative ideas y'all can provide. </p> 	Reviewing a question on Stackoverflow and reputation<p>Recently I could check it that the minimum reputation for reviewing - review first question/answer has been increased to 500.</p>  <p>Is there any hard thumb rule that defines the relevancy of reputation with review.</p>

duplicate	What's the proper action for LQP reviews of answers to shopping questions?<p>I came across <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/low-quality-posts/2690900">this low quality post review</a>.</p>  <p>The answer is of, at best, minimal value. It's a link only answer without a link; all you can do is search against the supplied product name. </p>  <p>I hesitate to select link only answer, though that would apply, because it's on a shopping question which just solicits links. All the other answers are only links as well, so it seems to me that deleting the reviewed answer for that reason might cause some cognitive dissonance in the poster, or fail to offer any insight as to why the question and answer aren't appropriate.</p>  <p>None of the other canned "recommend deletion" choices are valid. I could edit in a link to the product (and fix the other issues in the post), but I'm concerned that doing so would send the wrong message; that such answers are appropriate.</p>  <p>What's the correct review action to take here? I'm not wondering what to do about the question; I've already flagged it for closure.</p> 	Requested link only answers<p>In going through the review tool I often come across poor quality answers to poor quality questions. In particular, I will occasionally see questions that are simply asking for links to products, asking for tools, etc. Here are three examples that I've come across just this morning.</p>  <ol> <li><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review-beta/low-quality-posts/18026">http://stackoverflow.com/review-beta/low-quality-posts/18026</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review-beta/low-quality-posts/16762">http://stackoverflow.com/review-beta/low-quality-posts/16762</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review-beta/low-quality-posts/16535">http://stackoverflow.com/review-beta/low-quality-posts/16535</a></p></li> </ol>  <p>Clearly it's appropriate to go to the question and vote to close it (these are examples of not constructive) if they aren't already closed, but what should be done with the answers?  </p>  <p>Should the answer be marked for deletion? Much of the normal reasoning for not providing link only answers is defeated if the question is simply asking for links. I'm tempted to mark them as 'looks good' for that reason, because it's the question that is flawed. Is that correct, or should I evaluate all answers as if they were responding to a quality question?</p> 
non-duplicate	Define your own color of tagged-interesting<p>I don't like the <code>tagged-interesting</code> css-Class color. It is so glimmering. Would be great to define your own color.</p> 	Accept question of type "What is the best..." on any other sibling site, not necessarily Stack Overflow<p>I highly think that question of type "What is the best..." bring a lots of useful information to people. Perhaps it should not be accepted in Stack Overflow, I agree.</p>  <p>But I would really appreciate to have access to a site where I could ask those kind of questions. Ideally, the site will have a similar well tuned awards system as Stack Overflow. Also it would be nice if that site would have a very nice popularity as Stack Overflow. For each user on that site, just beside its reputation could be displayed the reputation from Stack Overflow (without being able to affect it) if it exists, that way it could help to evaluate the quality of an answer.</p>  <p>To add some considerations (explanations) to my suggestion, I invite you to read one of my really not popular question at meta.stackoverflow.com: <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/192461/question-of-type-what-is-the-best-why-not-where-to-go">Questions of Type: "What is the best..."</a></p>  <p>Sorry I just discover <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/">http://area51.stackexchange.com/</a> as Emrakul told me.

I know they serve a good purpose, but it seems like a rather short-term purpose to me.  Should we be deleting these after a few days, or is there a reason to keep them around long-term?</p>  <p>One reason I ask is that I'd like to rid Stack Overflow of the <code>not-programming-related</code> tag, but <em>a lot</em> of the questions with that tag are migration stubs.  If I just remove the tag it would spam the Active tab with a bunch of closed stubs.  <em>Not</em> preferred.  (Just removing the tag isn't my goal to begin with.

Note this might be <code>site:workplace.stackexchange.com</code> or <code>site:stackoverflow.com</code> depending on what site.</p>  <p>I notice a <em>lot</em> of questions closed as duplicates (rightly so) which leads me to believe I'm missing something about this.

The question probably contains a snippet of <em>sloppy</em> but not quite <em>awful</em> code; code indicating that the author, typically a new/low-rep user, possibly a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2004/03/02/82840.aspx" rel="nofollow">Mort</a>, doesn't really know what he's doing.  I'm not trying to be condescending here, he's probably very intelligent and hardworking, but in this <em>specific</em> case, he's clearly in way over his head.</p></li> <li><p><em>However</em>, as a <em>question</em>, it's not really too bad.  The goal and problem are both clearly stated.  The code is formatted (sort of).  Mort was polite and checked his spelling.  The question looks <em>answerable</em>, although from a rep perspective<sup>*</sup> it's an obvious dead-end, it's had maybe 3 views in the past 30 minutes.</p></li> <li><p>So you decide, <em>you know what, this person took the time to write up the question properly, he deserves an answer</em>, put on your good citizen hat and throw him a bone.  You slog through the ugly code, find the offending line, direct his attention to it and explain why it's wrong and how it needs to be fixed.</p></li> <li><p>Later, he leaves a comment saying that yes, that was indeed the problem and your answer helped him fix it <em>(great!)</em>.  Oh, but, now there's another problem <em>(uh-oh...)</em>. Something else is broken.  After letting out a long sigh, you read the comment and/or edited question, roll up your sleeves, and write up Take 2, hoping that's the end of it.</p></li> <li><p>And of <em>course</em> it's not the end.  Now maybe the error is gone, but it's not doing what it's supposed to.  If you're anything like me, your patience is now starting to wear thin. It's lousy code and you didn't volunteer to help him rewrite his whole app.  And of course, the question still only has 12 views, and nobody has upvoted either the question or your answer, <em>including the person you're helping</em>, so this is turning out to be a genuinely thankless task in all respects.  Welcome to "Family Tech Support", Web 2.0 Edition.</p></li> </ol>  <p><sub>* Which is of course just an arbitrary number that none of us care about. Not <em>really</em>, anyway. Not very <em>much</em>, at least.</sub></p>  <hr>  <p>So, here's where I get to <strong>my</strong> question.  At this point, do you:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Leave a comment, stating as politely as possible that you've done your best to help him answer the original question he asked, and if he has a new problem then he should start a new question?  <em>(I did this once, and actually ended up with an accept, but I felt kind of guilty afterwards, I don't think anybody answered his 2nd question).</em></p></li> <li><p>Bite the bullet and edit your answer a 3rd, 4th, 5th time, however many times it takes to resolve his issue, knowing full well that he may not even remember to accept the answer once you're done? <em>(I may work for free on SO, but that doesn't mean my time is worthless.)</em></p></li> <li><p>Just abandon the question, hoping that it will force Mort to start thinking for himself?</p></li> <li><p>Something else?</p></li> </ul>  <p>I've tried all three of the above and none of them ever quite feel right. I do want to help, but at the same time there are a lot more "lucrative" questions I could be answering. And I don't mind spending a lot of time on an answer either, <em>if</em> the question is interesting or important to me, but debugging is dull work.</p>  <p>I'd prefer not to reference specific questions here; I'm pretty sure that this is a shared experience, and my objective isn't to point fingers at "misbehaving" members.  I'm more looking for some practical advice on how to dig myself out of these pits of despair.</p>  <p>Anybody have any other ideas?</p>

Let's call it <code>four.[sitename-here].com</code>.</p> 	Where do I ask questions about product benchmarks and comparisons?<p>Sometimes I want to learn about a new programming related issue—topics such as DB ORM, search indexer, identity providers, logging, etc.</p>  <p>When I don't know anything about a subject, I ask for benchmarks or comparisons. I got some serious answers like links to tests, pros/cons, and Gartner's reviews. I found these very constructive and helpful. But then the question was blocked or deleted. Sometimes this happens even before I get an answer.</p>  <p>So where would it be more appropriate to ask questions about third party products and/or open source frameworks with which I am completely unfamiliar?</p> 
non-duplicate	Stack Overflow Client Failure limit web page?<p>So when I click on my profile, then go to responses, or a few other various pages on Stack Overflow, I got this ominous warning pop up and it doesn't load the web page.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VsRMJ.png" alt="SO Error"></p>  <p>I am not sure why at all, 90% of SO seems to be working fine.

I've thought up of a few <strong>possible answers:</strong></p>  <p><strong>ONE</strong> People work on other platforms on weekdays on their regular jobs then switch to php on weekends for freelancing work;</p>  <p><strong>TWO</strong> People work with other languages on weekdays but want to study/learn PHP, so they do it on weekends;</p>  <p><strong>THREE</strong> Could this show that, while programmers <em>have to</em> work with language A, B or C in their work, they <em>like</em> working with PHP?</p>  <p>I'll leave this for you guys now.

In this case we would be facing a good example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos%5Ftheory" rel="nofollow">deterministic chaos</a>, where fully deterministic initial conditions (here the scoring rules) can lead to unpredictable results.</p>  <p>Tiebreaker: </p>  <ul> <li>Which conditions would yield negative values?</li> <li>What would be the consequences of generalised individual negative scores when you know that:  <ol> <li>You need to have at least <strong>15</strong> reputation for up-votes and </li> <li><strong>100</strong> reputation for down-votes. </li> </ol></li> </ul>  <p>Can we imagine a situation where all users are below 15, meaning that newbies cannot     distribute or collect reputations?</p>

non-duplicate	Add some sort of feed back mechanism on the job descriptions in Careers<p>Some of the jobs descriptions and formatting in Careers are...not exactly optimal.  StackOverflow has a fantastic system for educating folks on better ways of asking and formatting questions.  Maybe Careers could introduce some sort of feedback mechanism for the job postings?  Here is an example of two mildly similar jobs from two different employeers:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/11858/program-manager-surround-technologies">Well formatted, clear, thoughtful</a></li> <li><p><a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/11965/project-manager-professional-everyday-health">Copy-paste, poor formatting, <em>PLZ SEND TEH L33T CODERZ</em></a></p>  <p><strong>edit</strong>: I (Korneel) cleaned this listing up</p></li> </ul>  <p>Obviously, edits are out of the quesiton.  But what about comments or votes?  They do not necessarily be visible to the entire world--just the submitter and the employer.  </p>  <p>The intended result of all this would be higher quality job postings by employers.  And a win-win for everyone.</p> 	Question history doesn't show change of title<p>Yesterday, I saw <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1696498/how-can-i-do-a-conditional-substitution-in-perl">this question</a> pop up on Stack Overflow. At the time, the question's title was something about "zero-width lookahead not working". </p>  <p>An hour later, it had a new title. The question's history doesn't reveal any edits to that effect. At first I thought the question was deleted and then re-posted with a new title. So I searched my browser's history, found the original question and made sure it had the same ID. </p>  <p>Is there a way to hide edits from others? Is this a bug? </p>  <p>(Yes, I am 100% sure that the question initially had a different title and no, I cannot provide any screenshots with freehand cirlces.)</p>

duplicate	Better flagging as off topic<blockquote>   <p>Related: <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/185867/no-custom-off-topic-message-when-flagging-on-so">No custom off topic message when flagging on SO</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>I recently noticed something: The off topic subreason chosen by flaggers doesn't make any difference at all. Specifically, the subreason chosen is not shown to close voters.</p>  <p>Besides, as the "other" reason is unavailable, a lot of cases that aren't covered by the custom off topic reasons aren't flaggable unless you use a moderator flag (which is less useful as it doesn't go into the review queues). This is a gap in the workflow, and not entirely intuitive for flaggers.</p>  <p>I propose that we give the flaggers <em>one</em> close off topic reason (and one migration reason)? It seems like the backend already treats custom close flags as the same.</p>  <p>The most obvious objection here (to me) is that it removes part of the usefulness of the close reasons -- the fact that, for flaggers and VTCers, it's much easier to determine whether or not the question should be closed. </p>  <p>However, this can be solved by nesting the close reasons under the description of a  generic "Does not fit the topic" close reason.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/o5xIK.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>Alternatively, just give flaggers an extra default close reason "This question does not appear to be about $Topic, within the scope defined in the help center."</p> 	No Suitable Reason to Recommend Close<p>In reviewing low quality posts, I cannot see a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/low-quality-posts/2596812">suitable option to close this</a>.</p>  <p>It was closed as:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GcTNc.jpg" alt="Closure reason"></p>  <p>The available options are as follows.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YJikX.jpg" alt="Close Options 1"></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CnuAN.jpg" alt="Doesn't belong here"></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cnliM.jpg" alt="Off topic options"></p> 
non-duplicate	Search with multiple criteria sometimes doesn't show results<p>Sometimes, when I do a search with two criteria, the search URL ends up containing a space (rather than a <code>+</code>), and then, sometimes, the server doesn't return the actual results, just the count and pagination.

duplicate	Can we get a more efficient way of contacting the team?<p>Right now there are two options a moderator can contact the team:</p>  <ol> <li>Pinging a team member in TL, or</li> <li>e-mail.</li> </ol>  <p>Both options are a bit crude, there's no easy way of knowing that a fellow mod has already contacted the team or an easy way to backtrack an issue.

The mod team bat signal would be more of an issue tracker than a private communication mechanism though, I don't expect the team to respond in any other way than a status.

duplicate	Can I "tip" someone who left a good comment on my answer?<p>Sometimes I post a "good" answer to a question, but then it turns out I missed something.  Someone else comes along and points out my error/omission in a comment, and I change my answer.  My answer is now <em>better</em>, freshly active, and I get more upvotes.  </p>  <p>However, I kind of feel that I owe that commenter a little bit of the credit (and therefore rep) for having helped support my answer.  I can upvote the comment, but there's no rep gain for that.</p>  <p>Is there any way I can give the commenter a portion of the rep I gain from further upvotes to what is now <em>our</em> answer?  I don't mind some approved existing solution, or some new totally manual solution, but it seems like it could be automated as well.</p>  <p>A similar question was asked in a comment to an answer here:</p>  <p><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/1558/174131">http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/1558/174131</a></p>  <p>and one suggestion (which was not popular) was to find some other questions/answers by the helpful commenter and upvote them.  I'm kind of in agreement that each post should gain upvotes of its own accord, and besides, there may not be enough other posts by that user to fully compensate them for their assistance.</p> 	Sharing reputation for good comments that contribute to the quality of the answer<p>Sometimes a comment can add great value to an answer once its content has been incorporated into the answer. Perhaps correcting an error to an otherwise good answer, plugging a logic hole, rendering a more elegant solution, making an important clarification to explanations, etc.</p>  <p>Once the answer has incorporated the comment/suggestion, it would be nice to credit the commenter with a "slice of the pie" - ie share reputation gains between the answerer and the commenter, as recognition of their contribution as "co author" to the final answer.</p>  <p>The simplest way would be to make upvotes on comments yield reputation, but that barrow has been pushed before.</p>  <p>A few possibilities I could think of for sharing rep are:</p>  <ul> <li>The commenter can be added to the answer as a "reputation sharer" - reputation gains from the answer are split 50/50 from then on</li> <li>The answerer can make a "donation" of reputation from the answer to the commenter - eg if the answer has 4 votes, they can donate up to 40 reputation (there may have to be a requirement that this donation comes off the rep cap, so answerers don't distribute their excess rep when exceeding their rep cap)</li> <li>Upvotes made by the answerer to comments on the answer <em>do</em> get reputation (maybe 5 - transferred as per previous point)</li> </ul>  <hr>  <p>Why bounty doesn't quite fit:</p>  <p>The bounty process is just too long winded and doesn't have an on-going effect if the answer turns out to be a really good one. The bounty is too delayed. They didn't <em>answer</em>, they just added value - I just want to give the comenter a pat on the back right there and then, and I don't mind giving up some erep to do it.</p>

duplicate	Could we please be a bit nicer to new users?<p>There is a distinct decline in the level of civility here.  Some of this is due to new users coming in and posting spam and other nonsense, but the offtopic and downvote buttons are doing a pretty good job of keeping this under control.  </p>  <p>Unfortunately, a lot of this is coming from more experienced users, and the site's built-in moderation system is not (and probably cannot) handle this very well.  Folks are rushing to pound new users down with "this belongs on meta!", "this is off topic", "this is a duplicate!" and "read the FAQ!".  All this, of course, is accompanied by a flurry of downvotes.  This is not very welcoming to new users who don't know about meta, or what is offtopic, or the FAQ.</p>  <p>Now I am not proposing that we just allow offtopic, meta, or duplicate questions.  However, I think we could be gentler in the way we express these sorts of things.  Explain what meta and the FAQ are and provide useful links.  Just using please and thank-you when asking folks to read the FAQ or post something on meta would be an improvement.  I also think we could rein in the downvoting a bit.  Not that we shouldn't vote stuff down, but unless a new user's post is clearly spam, voting it down to -1 or -2 should be sufficient to send a message without piling on.  </p>  <p>I like Stack Overflow and I want it to become a resource for everyone, not just an elitist site for people who were in the private beta.</p> 	Misery Business and the Yousuck effect<p>Well, it's been 4 months. And I am impressed.</p>  <p>I am also a bit disappointed.</p>  <p>Before you read this, take it with a pinch of salt. I'm kinda new, still. I'm still learning the ropes. But I've done a lot of browsing through old questions and new questions, and all the comments in between.</p>  <p>Why am I disappointed, you might ask? Well, I'm disappointed because of the (re)occurence of the yousuck effect. No, I'm not talking about the stern warnings to "read the faq" or the "please post your code". I'm talking about this question. And there are others, if anyone wants to add them.</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17904388/change-initialize-value-of-date-time-picker#comment26153235_17904388">Change initialize value of Date-Time Picker</a></p>  <p>The first comment on the question was by Mitch Wheat: "It's that time of day again..."</p>  <p>Look, I might have got an easy welcome to Stack Overflow. I posted some dumb stuff. I also posted some good questions, if I say so myself.</p>  <p>But just because it's the time of day where the foreign people (not sure from where because they could be many nationalities) come onto the site and post so-so questions <strong>DOES NOT</strong> mean that you should treat them like crap.</p>  <p>I know that I wouldn't want to be treated like a useless statistic if I was a foreign person with a question.</p>  <p>And for all those other high-rep people out there, I know what you are like. I know that you are generous. I know that you help me out when I get stuck. But please, please just realize that every new account is, well, a new person. And that is an account that should be treated with utmost respect. And really, the high-rep people should be setting the good examples.</p>  <p>... not to pick on you, but Mitch, I guess that the comment was deleted for a good reason. I think that it was a good move to delete it.</p>  <hr>  <p>So in conclusion, just realize that there are people who care. I hate this stuff. I did a "dodgy upvote" because I felt bad for the poor guy. So please, please just do the downvotes and the flags.

non-duplicate	Feature request: Automatcially detect non-tags<p>When I write a sentence that talks about, say, List&lt;string&gt; or vector&lt;int&gt;, it turns into "List or vector" in the preview (and I believe also when it is posted).</p>  <p>StackOverflow should detect these non-HTML tags and make replacements like "&lt;" to "&amp;lt;" automatically.</p>  <p>How to distinguish them from real HTML tags:</p>  <ol> <li>They aren't valid HTML tags</li> <li>There is no matching &lt;/string&gt; and &lt;/int&gt;</li> </ol> 	Why are suggested edit votes limited?<p>Is there a reason why I can only vote on 30 suggested edits per day?

duplicate	How can I cancel an edit I made on another user's question or answer?<p>Edits made by users who do not have edit privileges are placed in a queue until it is peer reviewed.</p>  <p>E.g., I edited someone else's answer. but changed my mind. If I'd edited my own question/answer, there would be a "Rollback" button, but there's no such button in the scenario I'm describing (at least none that I can see).</p>  <p><strong>Is there a way to remove one's edit from the peer review queue</strong>?</p> 	There should be a way to withdraw suggested edits<p>[TL;DR? Skip to "Bottom Line:" at the end. But I hope I made my post worth the length]</p>  <p>I was editing a post from the review queue. Apparently, if another edit is submitted while you're editing from a review, you don't get the prominent warning you get in non-review edits, with the conspicuous orange bar at the top of the page. You just get a very subtle notice in black-on-white text that's easy to miss (I only saw it when backtracking through the browser cache). So, the result was this: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/2646821">http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/2646821</a></p>  <p>As you indicated by my comment, I had actually made substantial formatting improvements to some very poorly formatted code, but in comparison to the previous edit, very little was left. But what's far worse is what happened above the code. As my comment said, I considered the question itself garbled beyond repair, and was leaving it to the OP to figure out what he wanted to say and then try to say it in English. However, the previous editor had made a valiant attempt at tackling that task, so my edit had the effect of restoring the <em>worst</em> parts of the original post.</p>  <p>I wanted to cancel my edit immediately, or withdraw it, or whatever you want to call it - roll it back, axe it, incinerate it, bury it and salt the ground above it,  wipe it from the face of the Earth and from all records and all memory and make it illegal to mention that it had ever existed, like the an act of the Ministry of Truth in <em>1984</em>. But I couldn't.</p>  <p>Sure, the edit was rejected, as it should have been. But three editors wasted their time on it, which they shouldn't have. And it bugs me to no end that this edit made me look like a <strong><em>complete idiot</em></strong>. The reason given by two of three editors was "This edit changes too much in the original post; the original meaning or intent of the post would be lost." Why? Because the side-by-side comparison makes it look like <em>I</em> actually added "Hi please kindly clear my doubt I have shown" and "Pls click edit given below button showing full coding" (ironic considering this other edit I had just made - see my comment: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/2646434">http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/2646434</a>), and even changed "and" to "adn"! It doesn't even give any indication that my edit is being compared to another edit; it looks as if my edit is being compared to the original. Heck, based on the information as it was presented to them, I'm surprised that none of the editors selected "vandalism" as the reason for rejection!</p>  <p>Note that this question has been asked before - <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/167285/cancel-an-edit-suggestion">Cancel a suggested edit</a> - but it was marked as a duplicate of this post: <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/157601/can-i-cancel-edit-my-own-suggested-edit-on-a-post-before-approval-rejection">Can I modify and resubmit my suggested edit before it is peer reviewed?</a> I <em>strongly</em> disagree that it was a duplicate. The question in the earlier post addressed a different issue, and the answer given was relevant to that issue and not this one. There's a big difference between wanting to resubmit an edit in order to improve it, and wanting to just outright withdraw an edit because it conflicts with another edit that it "crossed in the mail" (and possibly makes you look ridiculous to boot). The "grace period" to modify your edit while it's pending review doesn't help much if you just want to defer to the other edit that was submitted while you were working on your own edit.</p>  <p>My question <em>is</em> a duplicate of the falsely accused duplicate, but unfortunately that post was prevented from getting discussed by being marked as such.</p>  <p>[It's a separate topic for another time, but one thing I see all too frequently at SO is that some people are way too hasty to label anything that kind of sounds similar on a superficial level to something previously posted as a "duplicate". Here's an example of someone flagging one of my SO posts as a dupe, which completely missed the entire point of my question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17354850/whats-the-difference-between-the-throw-keyword-and-write-error-erroraction">What&#39;s the difference between the &quot;throw&quot; keyword and &quot;Write-Error -ErrorAction Stop&quot;?</a> The question I was allegedly duplicating may sound similar, but it wasn't even germane to what I was asking].</p>  <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> How about adding a feature to cancel an edit you suggested while it's pending review, so that if you realize you made a mistake or missed an update and are rolling back some improvements rather than making improvements, you can just yank it out of the queue so it won't waste the reviewers' time and in some cases make you look like a total jackass when you actually had made a good edit? Also, how about making the warning you receive about other edits being made while you're reviewing as conspicuous as the usual warning you get if another edit is made while you're working on an edit?</p>

duplicate	Rep changed without telling me why<p>I had two tabs open within chrome both of them on SO.  I looked at one and it had this:<br> <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wxxxl.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>I went back to the other tab on SO and it showed this:<br> <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RuUSM.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>I thought well where did I lose 15 points and click on my reputation page to see reputation activity (below) and nothing showed up as losing reputation.

duplicate	Why do we get random downvotes?<p>I and my friend used to ask programming questions on Stack Overflow, until we saw that 90% of our questions have at least 1 downvote and nobody cares to explain or at least give a clue why.</p>  <p>For example:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7352876/send-mouse-events-to-handle-in-c">Send mouse events to handle in C#?</a></li> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6509317/would-this-kind-of-encryption-be-good-at-anything">Would this kind of encryption be good at anything?</a></li> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6471055/start-program-with-a-scheduled-task-on-startup-with-c">Start program with a Scheduled Task on startup with C#?</a></li> <li><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/308327/webmatrix-iis-express-only-works-with-opera">WebMatrix/IIS Express only works with Opera!</a></li> <li><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/208706/bootable-program-to-format-the-internal-hdd">Bootable program to format the internal HDD?</a></li> <li>And many more on Super User...

Does it seem right to you? </p>  <p>It definitely doesn't seem right to me or my friend, who quit this website because of this.</p>  <p>Don't you think this must be stopped, possibly now?</p>  <p>You know, my problem here is that, when a question gets a downvote first (has overall negative reputation), it ceases to get views and thus less chances to get an answer.<br> I came to stack overflow to get answers on my questions, not to have their quality or reason questioned.</p> 	Random down voting of questions on Stack Overflow<p>I posted a question on Stack Overflow and got a down vote.</p>  <p>What I don't understand is the reason for down vote.

duplicate	Where should I post a question about software architecture?<p>I have a question about software architecture. I <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17917845/jsf-primefaces-spring-hibernate-mvc-development-guide">have posted it on Stack Overflow</a>.</p>  <p>Then the question got put on hold. Where should I post it?</p> 	Is there a site for software architecture questions?<p>The stackoverflow.com guidelines request specific questions that programmers would ask, no vague questions that would elicit discussion or debate. But as an architect a lot of my questions are just that. In a lot of cases I'm looking for other professionals opinions on a topic. An example is a question I was planning on asking today: "What are considered the best architectures for high volume data capture?" I have a need to design a system to capture a lot of small data elements and wanted to hear other opinions of the best way to do that.  </p>  <p>Is there a Stack Overflow sponsored forum to discuss those kinds of questions?</p> 
duplicate	Logged out, but still logged in?(not duplicate as answer for that duplicate is not my issue)<p>I found this question and still asking this again since I have clicked 'logout' button properly.(Two times, on top once and then the logout button appeared after this). After all these, I just clicked in the text box for openid, then It showed that I have logged in again. I am using chrome and it was in incognito mode. I cleared the cookies in content settings once.(But I don't see a reason for doing that since the message shows that your local settings will be cleared). </p>  <p>I tried 2 or 3 times and got this. And once I got the error saying this is our fault it is not you message.  </p> 	Logged out, but still logged in?<p>When I tried to log out by clicking the logout link at the top (<em>first time for me because I don't really log out of S[OFU] unless I clear my browser's session data</em>), I got the following message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>You're a registered user.</p>      <p>You can log in or out at any time   using the OpenID you've already   associated with your account.</p> </blockquote>  <p>And when I clicked on the parts of the site, it seems that I'm still logged in (<em>see, i'm creating this question after I logged out and this question would probably appear in the list of the questions I asked</em>) and my name is still appearing at the top of the page.</p>  <p>Is this by-design or is this a bug?</p> 
non-duplicate	Why did my improvement to an edit create a suggested edit to revert it?<p>I just improved an edit by changing one word <a href="http://workplace.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/5802">here</a>.</p>  <p>Immediately afterwards, I see <a href="http://workplace.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/5803">this</a> suggested edit which appears to be suggesting to reverse my edit.</p>  <p>Did the following happen?</p>  <ul> <li>User suggests edit</li> <li>I approve</li> <li>User changes edit again</li> </ul>  <p>Or why else did that happen? From my perspective it seems my improvement was rejected and then proposed as a change again.</p> 	Platinum Badges<p>Should there be a new level of badges added above gold, ie <code>Platinum</code> badges?  My reasoning is that two questions on SO (the programmer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/84556/whats-your-favorite-programmer-cartoon">cartoons</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/234075/programmer-jokes-whats-your-best-one">jokes</a> questions) have greater than 100k views, and several others are well above the 10k view requirement for the "Famous Question" badge.</p>  <p>Maybe SO should implement platinum badges, say for 250k views, getting 1k favorites or upvotes, things that are extremely rare but will happen eventually.  Since gold badges are so common now, I think it's fair to have some achievements that are extremely difficult to achieve.  What are your thoughts?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong>  Maybe the things like view-counts and stuff aren't the best example for achieving platinum badges.  Maybe it would be best to reward extremely stellar contributions, but I just like the idea of having some super-rare achievements.</p>

But when I use IE8 (under XP) on a different machine, I do not get that functionality.</p>  <p>Does anyone know how SO is doing that and why it might not be working in IE? All the other fancy Javascripty things work fine in IE, just not the spell checking.</p>

duplicate	Propose a privilege to sit in the 500 reputation mark<p>As <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/182586/do-we-still-need-the-retag-privilege">determined from earlier discussions</a>, the retag privilege serves a lot more confusion and a lot less of its benefit due to the suggested edit system. It must be done away with. It <em>will</em> be done away with. ♪</p>  <p>In light of this decided course of action, we're going to need a new snack for the road between "Create Tags" at 300 reputation and "Established User" at 1000 reputation. We'd like your help in thinking about some ideas on what would be a nice privilege to sit at this level. Since we're... a bit dry on our end.</p>  <p>The primary guideline in deciding what kind of privilege to put here is acknowledging its position in the overall hierarchy of privileges. 500 reputation is an early-intermediate user, one who has started to really get the hang of the site and its function. It can be something that provides convenience in how they currently can act on the site, or it could be some new functionality that fits as an early ability (especially considering there's no new abilities until 2000 reputation's "Edit Everywhat" ability).</p>  <p>I look forward to hearing what creative ideas y'all can provide. </p> 	Why have my privileges on Stack Overflow changed?<p>On Stack Overflow, I have a reputation of 189 and I used to have the ability to review posts. On Stack Overflow chat, I had no restrictions on chatting.</p>  <p>Now, suddenly, the "Review" option has disappeared, and in chat, most rooms seem to be locked.</p>  <p>Nothing appears to have changed on my SO profile, and I received no notifications of any sort that my rights were somehow being limited.</p>  <p>Has there been changes to SO policies/levels? If so, what were those changes? If there hasn't been any change to SO policies, then what gives with my account?</p>

duplicate	Why is the net speed of Stack Overflow so fast?<p>This question is about the net speed.</p>  <p>I'm from China, and I find that opening pages on Stack Overflow is <em>very</em> fast, normally within a range of 1 to 4 seconds. This speed is very good for a website outside China; it's even faster than some native websites.</p>  <p>Not every website outside China has such good speed, so I am wondering why and how Stack Overflow manages to be so quick.</p> 	Page download speed of Stack Overflow. What's the tech and trick?<p>I am baffled by the way Stack Overflow pages are loaded. Even through a mobile connection.(Where download speed is 8kbps &amp; I am not talking about the mobile site. I am taking about using the mobile as a modem and accessing Stack Overflow through a desktop browser).</p>  <p>What makes Stack Overflow pages download so instantaneous? I have seen AJAX coming into play all the time. This is made more explicit when I see the header and footer remaining fixed and content changes slowly (Thanks to mobile connection). And they also use something like <code>Stackexchange.ready()</code>. What is that about?</p>  <p>Overall what do they use and how are they doing it so good?</p>  <p>I am really curious. The only other site I have seen that shows this kind of optimization is Google's main page.</p> 
duplicate	Make a dark theme available for Stack Overflow<p>Stack Overflow should provide users the option of using a dark site design/theme. Why is this feature missing? The major IDEs are already a letdown regarding dark color schemes.</p> 	Nighttime "light on dark" skin<p>It would be good to be able to view SO using light text on dark background.</p>  <p>The use case is evening or night on a mobile device when you don't want alert your significant other that you're lurking on SO, which has quite distinctively bright, mostly white pixel, pages.</p>  <p>It may also reduce battery use.</p> 
non-duplicate	Feature to rate sites?<p>There are sites that I read, but am not a member of. This goes for a lot of people, including every anonymous user. From my time on the site, I will form opinions about it, although I can't inform the site as a meta post wouldn't be appropriate.</p>  <p>Wikipedia has a way to rate articles based on certain criteria (located at the bottom of articles), is there a way we could do the same thing for each site?</p>  <p>(Updated) Criteria could be:</p>  <ul> <li>References (If the site contains links to other sites)</li> <li>Objective (If the site contains objective answers)</li> <li>Instructive (How well the site explains its answers)</li> <li>Appearance (How the site looks)</li> </ul>  <hr>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> </p>  <p>A meta post isn't a good way to give individual evaluations of a site, especially for non-members. It's useless as a post - it can't be measured and is forgotten within a week. Not to mention that voting on a meta post reflects the view of the site, not the outside world. </p>  <p>Voting is something which <em>can</em> be measured. It's by far more useful then a whiny rant, which is why SE is based around it. Leave meta to find solutions to the problems, not speculate on what they are.</p>  <p>Now, let me explain the use:</p>  <p>I read UX every now and then, mostly when it appears on the front page. I don't know much about user experience, but I still enjoy learning about it, and the site is a great way to do so. Now, I see several answers that are just an opinion with little explanation and I dislike that aspect of the site. I don't know where UX stands on this - I haven't read their meta posts, or even their FAQ (as I'm not a member), but I still feel that my input could have some use.</p>  <p>And so I would vote:</p>  <ul> <li><code>References -- 2/5</code></li> <li><code>Objective --- 2/5</code></li> <li><code>Instructive - 3/5</code></li> <li><code>Appearance  -- 4/5</code></li> </ul>  <p>And after a few months, enough data would be gathered to accurately represent the current site. This would then be used to improve the site.</p> 	Is it possible to receive email update from favorites?<p>Here is my scenario:</p>  <p>i have a problem that is already in question on stackoverflow. i shouldn't add a comment to that question just to say "me too" and receive email updates. that is why i mark that question as "favorite" witch allows me to receive updates on the news feed.</p>  <p>the problem is: sometimes i stay almost a week not entering stackoverflow and because of that i really would like to receive this notifications by email.</p>  <p>in this answer: <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/106380/165597">http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/106380/165597</a> i found that i can create custom emails for some tags, but i couldn't find how make this "notification emails" for the favorites questions.</p>  <p>is there any way of doing it? a way to receive updates of questions that i`m not directly involved?</p>

The review possibilites only allow to keep the "answer" or flag it (which will usually result in a deletion).</p>  <p><strong>Most of these "answers" are indeed valid comments, providing useful questions, links, etc.!</strong></p>  <p>It would add value to Stackoverflow (etc) to convert these answers to a comment (below the initial question) with one click.</p> 
non-duplicate	Should I downvote a question if the title doesn't match the description?<p>I came across a <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/2099">question</a> that had a title that did not match the description of the problem. The title indicated a generic problem but the description described the particular problem with the software the person was using. He got an answer that solved his particular issue but not the generic problem described in the title. So while useful for this particular person, the answers are not useful to others (me) and the title misleading. </p>  <p>I feel that this should be a reason for downvoting the question for inconsistency. Am I missing something here or am I correct?</p> 	Close reason changed: Comparing old with the new<p>Recently, the options on the closed vote reasons on StackOverflow have changed.  I was curious about the differences, and would like a bit of clarification on the new one.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>This question was caused by a problem that can't be reproduced or a simple typographical error. While similar questions may be on-topic here, this one was solved in a manner unlikely to help future readers. This can often be avoided by identifying and closely inspecting the shortest program necessary to reproduce the problem before posting.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Whereas the previous said:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Questions asking for code must demonstrate a minimal understanding of the problem being solved. Include attempted solutions, why they didn't work, and the expected results. See also: Stack Overflow question checklist</p> </blockquote>  <p>Now, perhaps these are completely different reasons and should not be compared.  But given that one replaced the other, I'm curious if this indicates a shift in how we respond to a question that doesn't include code, but is asking for code.</p>  <p>This first would seem to indicate that the question, while it may include code, might be too specialized to be of value.  Those exist, to be sure, but seem much more rare.  Whereas questions that do not contain code, but ask for it, are prevalent.</p>  <p>If this is the case, what is the best way to respond to the myriad of questions that ask for code, but show no effort?  And is there subtly that I am missing in the new answer that I might look for in other questions?</p> 
duplicate	Broken links for changing page in SO -> Users<p>The page links in squares at the bottom of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users">Users</a> are broken, as in this example:</p>  <pre><code>http://stackoverflow.com/users?page=2&amp;amp;tab=reputation&amp;amp;filter=week </code></pre>  <p>Note extra "amp;" after "&amp;".</p>  <p>Actually, the links do work, but the GET attributes are lost. For instance, if you choose <code>filter=ALL</code> and then try to pass to page 2, you go back to default <code>filter=WEEK</code>.</p> 	Pagination links børken everywhere<p>The pagination at the bottom of the users pages uses links that have all the parameter delimiters (<code>&amp;</code>) escaped to <code>&amp;amp;</code>.</p>  <p>The <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users?tab=reputation&amp;filter=all">overall users rank</a> page for example, links to <code>http://stackoverflow.com/users?page=2&amp;amp;tab=reputation&amp;amp;filter=all</code> instead of to <code>http://stackoverflow.com/users?page=2&amp;tab=reputation&amp;filter=all</code>. Because of this the weekly rank, page two, is shown instead.</p>  <p>This is not limited to just the user pages; it appears that all pagination links are affected. </p>  <ul> <li>The same problem can be seen with search result pagination, this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=python+list+comprehension">example search</a> renders the link to page 2 as <code>http://stackoverflow.com/search?page=2&amp;amp;tab=relevance&amp;amp;q=python%20list%20comprehension</code>. The second page returns no results because of this.</li> <li>The <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'python'" rel="tag">python</a> tag page pagination links to <code>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python?page=2&amp;amp;sort=newest&amp;amp;pagesize=50</code>. Page two is returned but any sorting or page size parameters are lost. Because the site uses cookies for the <code>sort</code> and <code>pagesize</code> parameters this problem is less severe.</li> <li>For 10k+ users, you can filter the review queue history page to show only your own reviews; when you switch that on the pagination links there are broken as well: <code>http://stackoverflow.com/review/close/own/history?page=2&amp;amp;userid=100297</code> for the close review history page, page two, filtered on my own reviews.</li> </ul>  <p>The footer software revision is rev 2013.8.30.981 and this problem appears to be browser independent.</p> 
duplicate	Posting a comment about flagging a post<p>I apologize if this question has already been asked but I've searched high and low and not found an answer. Commonly, on SO and many other Stack Exchange sites, when I see a post flagged as a duplicate, spam, off-topic, and so on, someone will post a comment like "Off-topic; belongs on Server Fault or possibly Super User". Is this good practice? Should this be done? Is this something the flagger should do after submitting a flag? To me it seems a bit offensive and could garner dispute from an argumentative poster, but that's just my opinion. </p>  <p>As a quick example, a comment like this can be found here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9426804/setting-up-phpmyadmin-with-wamp-server">setting up phpMyAdmin with WAMP server</a> posted by a Mr. Jim Garrison.</p> 	"Belongs on" comments<p>This is related to <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/18488/what-to-do-when-a-user-asks-the-same-question-on-two-so-family-sites-and-the-orig">this</a> question. I think we should discourage "Belongs on S[OFU]" type comments. I think they encourage the OP to go to the indicated site and re-ask the question. Flagging/voting to move on the question should be sufficient. Assuming this is the case, would it be proper to flag those comments for mod removal to hopefully get them removed before a new user sees them and duplicates the question?</p>  <p>Or, another example:</p>  <p><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/146388/uk-change-to-gmail"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100529-pf738uyhmggwqir4qgp4ah4i6w.png"></a></p>  <p>Or, even worse, but this new (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/350821/amardeep">valuable</a>!) user probably just doesn't know better:</p>  <p><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/151184/format-an-external-hard-disk"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100610-rincffwa8xfyu9d8583jw5b4dq.png"></a></p> 
duplicate	Unable to post on meta after a certain number of downvotes<p>It seems after you reach a certain number of downvotes (at least on meta), you lose the ability to post. <strong>Why?</strong> </p>  <p>I also wonder if the algorithm is taking into consideration if the downvotes were spread among several posts or if a single post got many downvotes or if the reason is even considered. If this is a dummy automated algorithm, it needs to be revised.</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>  <p>I also wanted to add that there needs to be a distinction between poor posts and posts (proposed ideas or complaints) which garner a lot of disagreements, hence downvotes. People here tend to downvote something they don't agree with, regardless of the quality of the post. Also some tend to follow the herd. The more a post gets downvotes, the stronger the temptation to downvote it even further by the next visitors.</p>  <p>Also note that meta has a 'discussion' tag. No not every answer or comment here is an answer. This differentiates meta from the rest of the SE sites.</p> 	Down votes should not have any side effect, on meta<p>After my <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/90091/meta-stackoverflow-downvotes-should-not-exist">first suggestion</a>, I've now got a new suggestion: down votes should not have any side effect in meta.</p>  <p>By side effects, I mean something like banning me from asking questions due to too many down votes, which I am experiencing right now:</p>  <p><a href="http://postimage.org/image/1f8zll3l0/" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cLhWH.gif" alt="Blocked!"></a></p>  <p><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/86997/what-can-i-do-when-getting-sorry-we-are-no-longer-accepting-questions-from-this/86998#86998">This question</a> states that I am permanently banned unless I improve my standing by posting some quality answers.</p>  <p>Seriously, I'm new to the site, and thus I'm not capable of posting quality answers on Meta.</p>  <p>So my only refuge was to create a new account. I think this check for previously downvoted posts should be disabled on Meta.</p>

If you leave it a minute or so, then values get properly updated.</p>  <p>Maybe this was related to today's downtime?</p> 	What is the sort order of tags in a CV for Careers2.0?<p>You can select tags you want to be displayed in your CV in to "Top [10-20-30]%" section.</p>  <p>But the order seems to follow the the global SO popularity of a tag (i.e. the number of questions on a tag), and not the order of tags of my profile.</p>  <p>If I want certain tags to be <strong>immediately visible</strong> (i.e. <strong>without having to click on "more"</strong>), I need to <em>not</em> select other tags I have some knowledge in (while not having done many answers on them), in order to make sure a less popular tag (I am heavily invested in) is visible.</p>  <p>However, should the tag order follow my <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/6309/vonc#tags-table">own "tags section"</a>, I wouldn't have this issue, since the tags I want always visible are the ones I am the most active in.</p>  <p>Is my interpretation of the current tag order correct?<br> Is it possible to have that order follow the user account tags, instead of a global sort order criteria?</p> 
non-duplicate	What does it mean when 'close(1)' appears in your question instead of just 'close'?<p>I notice that in one question the close button has a one in parenthesis:</p>  <pre><code>link | edit | close(1) | delete | flag </code></pre>  <p>Does this mean someone has voted to close the question?  If so, how do I see and respond to their comments and reasons for wanting to close it?</p> 	Stackoverflow Language Research<p>I recently asked a SO question about <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1894453/development-time-in-various-languages">language productivity</a>.  </p>  <p>What emerged from the question was that there really was not much good research into the topic of language productivity and that any research which had been done was from the 2000 time-frame. What makes research like this difficult is finding a large sample size and finding problems which don't favour one class of language greatly over another. That got me thinking, what better source of programmers is there than stackoverflow? There are developers from all across the spectrum of languages and abilities; there is even a pretty good geographic disbursement.</p>  <p>Let's do this research ourselves! I propose a stackoverflow language programming contest. We'll develop a suite of programming tasks which try as hard as possible to not focus on the advantages of one particular language and gather metrics. I think we should gather</p>  <ul> <li>Time taken to develop</li> <li>Lines of code required</li> <li>Runtime over the same input</li> <li>Memory usage over the same input</li> <li>Experience of the programmer (years or some other metric, KLOCs written?  Degrees?) </li> <li>Other things I haven't thought of</li> </ul>  <p>I'll set up a site to gather people's solutions to the problems and collate statistics but the problems should be proposed by the community. We'll allow people to checkout the problem set, time how long it takes to the to complete it and then submit the code for their answers. I'll run the code and benchmark the results and after, say two weeks of having the contest open, publish my results as well as the dataset for anybody else to analyze. </p>  <p>What do people think?  Would any of you participate? What questions do you propose?  Can you think of other metrics?  Which languages?  I would think at least</p>  <ul> <li>Java</li> <li>C</li> <li>C#</li> <li>Ruby</li> <li>Perl</li> <li>Python</li> </ul>

It may also be useful to get feedback on which comments are helpful to others.</p>  <p>Related: <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/148066/can-i-search-my-comments-using-some-keywords">search by keyword</a>, <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/23771/how-can-i-search-stackoverflow-comments">search comments</a>, etc.</p> 	Show vote counts on activity>comments page<p>It would be helpful to show vote counts on the <strong>activity</strong> > <strong>comments</strong> page, and also allow sorting by votes.</p>  <p>This would make it easy to see what comments other people thought were valuable or at least amusing.</p> 
non-duplicate	How can i delete the questions in stackoverflow?<p>I have asked some questions here. Now I don't want that questions into my profile.

I know that there have been times that my question was not very straight forward and someone from twitterville actually came in and answered it for me...</p>  <p>This would essentially be a one way form of communication, maybe a button in each post that would allow you to tweet the post's link with a brief text input (obviously keeping the entire post to under 140 characters)</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong><br> you can argue that SO is not a social networking site, but that does not imply that there is no value or utility to be had there by some form of integration.</p>

I usually ask on Stack Overflow.</p>  <p>I have a situation, or "story", that involves: programming ethics, employer-employee relationship, company stocks, code property and taking decisions.</p>  <p>So, there are a few meta-questions:</p>  <ol> <li>On what Stack Exchange site can I post this situation?</li> <li>Is it wrong to ask for opinions? because there might not be an accepted answer.

You could call it <code>Diaper Overflow</code>.  ;-)</p> 	Is Code Formatting not a Valid Reason for a Post Edit?<p>I am trying to be a good community member and regularly edit questions to improve the formatting.  I believe it is easier for the community to find a fault in some code if it is correctly formatted.  I am not talking about a single incorrectly formatted line, but about a whole blocks of code WITHOUT any formatting.</p>  <p>Lately, a lot of my suggested edits have received "rejections" because they were deemed "too minor".  </p>  <p>A good example would be the my <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/1711877">edit #1711877</a> </p>  <p>So my question is:  Should I stop editing formatting issues?  What would not be deemed "too minor"? </p>  <p>I don't want to mess with the editing if it is not welcomed in this community, but would continue if it is deemed helpful.  So what's the verdict?</p>

This is why I've created a new question, given that the previous one has the 'status completed' tag.</p>  <p>I would like to see a better system for handling captcha throttle thresholds on users. Currently, according to <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/1/jeff-atwood">Jeff Atwood</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Some reductions in CAPTCHA throttle   thresholds, if you have > 10k rep:</p>      <ul>   <li>for edits -- reduced by two-thirds</li>   <li>for post submission times --   min seconds   reduced by one half, max minutes   increased by 2x</li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>My point is that 10k reputation is <strong>waaaaay</strong> too high. As has been suggested, there should be some form of scaling involved in the threshold, rather than this system where editing/re-editing your posts confronts you with those damned loveable robots.</p>  <p>So, I would like to ask that you start scaling back the threshold when the user hits something lower, say 500, or 1000.</p>

non-duplicate	Shouldn't Area 51 have discussion features?<p>Area 51 has the same look &amp; feel as the other SO sites which makes sense since it will be intuitive to its users. I guess that it also has to do with the fact that they use the same underlying platform. But I feel that the definition phase would benefit from some sort of discussion board. What happens now when people want to discuss the scope of a new site is that the comment area at the top turns into a discussion board (but without the features that you would expect from a discussion board).

non-duplicate	Attribution Required for non-web media<p>I read the blog post "<a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/attribution-required/">Attribution Required</a>" by Jeff Atwood. As I understand the post, SE "require[s]" that reusers "Hyperlink directly to the original question", that reusers "Hyperlink each author name", that users use "standard HTML", and that "the links must not be nofollowed." Taken literally, this would mean that republishing substantial portions of a question or answer in any medium other than the web would infringe copyright, as would republishing in web environments that forbid hyperlinks to SE sites. It would end up ruling out substantial quoting in the following situations:</p>  <ul> <li>Print, because hyperlinks are impossible. URLs may be printed, but that's like using nofollow.</li> <li>Sites like Everything2, because external hyperlinks are disabled as a spam control measure. URLs may be posted as text, but that's like using nofollow.</li> <li>Several web sites' comment systems, because external hyperlinks are disabled as a spam control measure. They reject any post that contains text that looks like a URL.</li> </ul>  <p>What did I misunderstand?

non-duplicate	Should outdated answers be voted down?<p>On Stack Overflow, there are many questions that relate to currently-developing technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3. The accepted answers to these questions may become outdated, and better answers may appear. However, because the answers are accepted, it is likely that they will continue to be upvoted by users reading the answers, and the OP will likely not notice that a better, more up-to-date answer may exist.</p>  <p>Should these outdated answers be voted down? If not, what should we do with them?</p> 	Use tag synonyms when migrating questions<p><sub>[Note: I know this question is similar to <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/59255/tag-synonyms-system-not-working-on-migrated-question">Tag synonyms system not working on migrated question?</a>, but its answer doesn't answer <em>this</em> question.]</sub></p>  <p>Over at Apple.SE, we've just started getting migrated questions, and that's caused things to get a little funky. Here's an example:</p>  <ul> <li>We currently have the tag <code>[podcasts]</code>, which has a synonym of <code>[podcast]</code>.</li> <li>A question with the tag <code>[podcast]</code> on its source site gets chosen for migration.</li> <li>When the question is imported, the <code>[podcast]</code> tag ignores that it's a synonym and gets added to the tag db.</li> <li>We end up with something that's both a tag <em>and</em> a synonym.</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Request</strong>: When applicable, tags on imported questions should be rewritten to their synonyms, just as if the question had been asked directly.</p>  <p>I'm not asking that anything be done about new tags; those aren't a problem. This is about tags for which we've already got synonyms, where ignoring those synonyms gets messy and causes extra work for mods.</p>

The problem is viewers may still assume the edit is old.</p> 	Automatically remove accepted answer checkmark after two years<p>Technology changes rapidly. Perhaps this is not as true for other exchanges such as history, chess, or the English language. However, it is true for Stack Overflow. Many times, older questions have answers which are no longer accurate.</p>  <p>Removing the accepted answer checkmark after 2 years will allow the question to become under review by the person who originally posed it. This will allow them to re-accept an answer and gain some reputation for having ensured that the answer was still applicable to the situation. This will also allow more relevant answers to be posed and accepted as answered to the situation if they are more correct than what was previously posted. It will also allow answers which contain links to be checked for link validity.</p>  <p>Overall, this will keep older content fresh.</p>  <p>"To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science." -Albert Einstein</p>

This is the answer I got from a fellow user with higher rep and more privileges than me:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>As far as I am aware, this part is not designed well. There are several ways:</p>      <ul>   <li>There is a <a href="http://japanese.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits">list of suggested edits</a>, but the access to this page is limited to the users with <a href="http://japanese.stackexchange.com/privileges/moderator-tools">access to the 10k tools</a> (≥2,000 rep points during beta, ≥10,000 rep points outside beta).

Is it a badly designed system? Is it a bug in the difference between beta sites and fully fledged sites where the different amount of rep required to get the "approve tag wiki edits" and "access to moderator tools" privileges?

duplicate	Reply-to autocomplete is blocking Enter from submitting the comment<p>We can submit comments by pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. Great, I'm always using it and guess many others as well, rarely clicking the button.</p>  <p>When we type <code>@</code> followed by a letter (or when there's a commentator with display name starting with unicode character) the autocomplete  box pops up, suggesting possible users to choose from. Excellent and very useful, we can even stick with the keyboard and press <kbd>tab</kbd> to select. Pressing any other key then close the list and all is good in the world, especially when the <code>@</code> reply is in the beginning of the comment.</p>  <p><strong>But</strong>, if we want to have the <code>@</code> reply at the end of the comment, or coming back to change the name then want to submit the comment... we press <kbd>Enter</kbd> and nothing happens. Pressing again, still nothing. Third time, using more force... still no icecream and no comment. The focus is on the autocomplete list!</p>  <p>The only way to have our beloved <kbd>Enter</kbd> work again is close the autocomplete list and this can be done only by pressing other key then backspacing it. Not even <kbd>tab</kbd> will close it, just select a name, and <kbd>Esc</kbd>  won't do any good either.</p>  <p>What I suggest is that <kbd>Enter</kbd> will close the autocomplete list, if open, with or without selecting it doesn't really matter.</p> 	Comment submission broken for comments that end with @username<p>Sometimes I want to post comments that include @-notifications but can't work the names into the comment text organically. In those cases, I write my comment out and then tack on a <code>@JohnDoe</code> at the end, which works just fine.</p>  <p>Well, it <em>did</em> work, until the otherwise-awesome new name autocompleter was introduced. Now I type out <code>@JohnD</code> and hit <kbd>Tab</kbd>, and the whole name appears, but I can't submit the comment by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> anymore. The <kbd>Enter</kbd> key just does nothing. And actually, it doesn't matter if I tab-complete the name or not.</p>  <p>I don't think it's just me because it happens on multiple computers, although they're both running Win7 Pro and recent Firefoxes. Also, I would understand &#8212; but disagree &#8212; if this was considered "not a bug, just reword all your comments that end this way."</p>  <p>EDIT:<br> As the ever-intrepid pseudo-employee Tim Stone pointed out in the comments, what I initially reported is a special case of a more general problem: <kbd>Enter</kbd> submission of comments fails whenever the tab complete suggestions are being shown.</p>

It's about a web server so it might be answerable on Server Fault but it's really more of a programming thing, hence the posting the question on Stack Overflow.  </p>  <p>Is there any way to make the question visible on multiple sites (crosspost) and then accept the answer wherever it came from?</p>  <p><a href="/q/7931">Return to FAQ index</a></p> 	Why is cross posting discouraged?<p>Suppose, a question can have two different answers in two sites, is it allowed?</p>  <p>Why is cross posting always discouraged? </p>  <p>Is it for saving the Stack Exchange system memory?

The mouse movings give me muscle ache.</p> 	Can the comment deletion modal popup be replaced, or at least tweaked?<p>Modal dialog popups have always been a great bugbear most everywhere, and it just got worse - or perhaps simply more noticeable. At least for Chrome v29.0.1547.57m, there are some changes that cause the following problems when deleting comments:</p>  <ul> <li>The popup is only centred horizontally, appearing centre-top of the view port;</li> <li>the popup is blocking between windows and tabs - sure this <em>didn't</em> happen before;</li> <li>the style adjustments actually make an obviously horrible thing one has to address into a very subtle thing one has to address - there is no <em>ping!</em>, no flashing, or jumping to the thing that needs attention etc.)</li> </ul>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PP8TD.png" alt="Modal popup in Chrome, subtle and blocking"></p>  <p>FireFox had altered the look of the popup a while back, though the effects are not as bad.</p>  <p>Hopefully these are all some manifestations of some terrible mistake that managed to get checked in and deployed and will be fixed, like, yesterday. In the meantime, and in case it <em>is</em> a design decision, can we either:</p>  <ul> <li>replace it with an "in-page markup popup", or</li> <li>try to tweak it so as to at least be centre of the viewport?</li> </ul>

duplicate	Improve selection/ranking of favorite sites and feed for the android app<p>It looks like the favorite sites are sorted by reputation and the feed picks up on this as well. Fair enough in general, but for me, it's definitely wrong. I used to be reasonably active on SO and am still accumulating plenty of reputation from old posts there, but now I'm primarily active on cooking. I can't actually tell whether it's using total reputation or recent gain; I still gain plenty from old posts on SO.</p>  <p>The favorite sites and feed should use recent activity for ranking, not just reputation.</p>  <p>(I found <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/191593/favorite-tags-selection-in-navigation-bar-feed">this question</a>, but I'm definitely suggesting automated selection here, not manually curated tag sets.)</p> 	Feed shows only Stack Overflow<p>The feed in the Stack Exchange Android app only shows new questions from Stack Overflow.

duplicate	Don't show protections on closed questions<p>I just noticed <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/116891/will-stack-overflow-boycott-godaddy-because-of-their-support-for-sopa">this question</a>, the GoDaddy-SOPA one.</p>  <p>On thing that confused even me, as a 6k user on Meta, was this:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MDwLj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>Now, I knew after a second's thought that the question was closed and no new answers were being accepted. However, that protection threw me off. Specifically the last line: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>To answer it, you must have earned at least <strong>10 reputation</strong> on this site.</p> </blockquote>  <p>So... If I have 10 rep I can answer it?</p>  <p>No, but that's what it says.</p>  <p>The whole point of a protection is to keep answers from new users clogging up the question. If the question is closed, it doesn't need the protection, right? If it is later reopened, the protection should come back.</p>  <p>Therefore, I propose that we simply <strong>hide the protection indicator</strong> when a question is closed,** to reduce a small amount of confusion.</p> 	Don't display "protected" notice if the question is locked or closed<p>If the question is locked, obviously new users can't post answers to it because <em>no one</em> can post answers. It seems somewhat redundant to list that box there. I'm not saying remove the protection from the question just because it's locked. After all, a question <em>can</em> be unlocked (although unlikely). However, it <em>is</em> unlikely and it's just an extra box there that doesn't really mean anything on the post anymore.</p>  <p>Most notably for the "protected" box, it states:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>To answer it, you must have earned at least 10 reputation on this site.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Yet, because it's locked, that statement is untrue.</p>  <hr>  <p>The "protected" box should be hidden when it is not possible to add additional answers to the question in the first place, which includes when the question is locked or closed. If the question is unlocked or reopened, it should be shown again.</p> 
non-duplicate	Is there a thread on this site where someone can practice mardown<p>I've been trying to use markdown in comments and they never come out right. </p>  <p>When starting a thread, the system show what the markdown will eventually produce before you submit it.

Yes, the reputation points that is lost on a down-vote is very minimal. But just because the amount of reputation points lost is less, down-voting without comments should not be encouraged. </p>  <p>I have seen points on why a comment shouldn't be made mandatory while down-voting. Those are also understandable. It is fine to not mandate a comment. </p>  <p>But can't we have a "raise flag" option (like we have for spam posts) where users with a certain minimum rep can request for moderator review if they feel that a good and credible post is down-voted for no obvious reason?</p> 	What is serial voting and how does it affect me?<p>I just noticed that I lost a bunch of points from my reputation score on Stack Overflow, and I used the "reputation" tab on my user profile page to try and track down the cause.</p>  <p>During my investigation, I noticed there was an unusual event of type "reversal".

They're not good enough to deserve an <strong>Upvote</strong> and not bad enough to deserve a <strong>Downvote</strong>, there's no point in <strong>editing</strong> them except maybe to correct one letter, there's no need for a <strong>comment</strong> and they don't have spam or bad language to <strong>flag</strong>.</p>  <p>Because the numbers are decreasing the more you "review" it gives you a some-how rewarding feeling, that you're helping decreasing the problems. But at the same time they're putting a pressure on the user to do something in order to unlock that awesome <kbd>I'm Done</kbd> button.

duplicate	The Reputation Model for Voting<p>I have been with StackOverflow since almost more than a year (as a user). I have always been willing to contribute to StackOverflow by voting for the best contributions at the very least.</p>  <p>The problem is: I don't have the need to code extensively, so I really don't have any unique questions - all of them so far had been asked! And since I am much of a beginner to coding world, I really don't have answers to any questions as they are of a good stature!</p>  <p>I am able to find answers to my questions very easily on SO or Google. But if I don't ask question, and if I am not good enough to answer a question - how ever will I be able to vote (to Vote you require 15 Rep!). And yes, I have been helped by users extensively - I have over 50 bookmarks saved over my browsers for really good questions and answers! All I have is 1 Rep on SO, I just can't vote!</p>  <p>What else can you do to improve your rep when you are starting off at 1? Or at least, should voting be given a privilege to all the beginners?</p> 	How does a new user begin using Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange?<p>As a new user, I find it impossible to contribute to the community or to even <em>begin</em> contributing. I know why the reputation system is in place and I respect it, but at the same time it is too hard on new users.</p>  <p>It started with me wanting to upvote a question...</p>  <blockquote>   <p>"Vote Up requires 15 reputation"</p> </blockquote>  <p>Just to appreciate a good question that helped me I need 15 rep? OK..., so I find out how I can get reputation points. More or less, I need to ask a question for +5 and add an answer for +10. I don't have any questions at the moment and I <em>don't</em> want to spam a random question, but I did happen to have a slightly different answer to the earlier question that I wanted to upvote. So I try to answer...</p>  <blockquote>   <p>This question is protected to prevent "thanks!", "me too!", or spam answers by new users. To answer it, you must have earned at least 10 reputation on this site.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Now... I know this doesn't apply to every question, but at the same time, this means I'm forced to answer yet another question, and I don't want to go around looking for random questions and spam irrelevant answers...  Now I'm stuck. So I try to talk to some other users in the chat rooms about how to go about getting reputation points and how they first started. I entered into a "casual chat room".</p>  <blockquote>   <p>You must have 20 reputation on Meta Stack Overflow to talk here.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Yes... I can understand why this is enforced, because we don't want new users to spam chat rooms, but all I wanted to do was ask for help. So I can't even talk to anyone about my newbie problems. So okay, I'll just settle for upvoting comments in the question that helped me. I don't see an upvote hover-over button so I can't even do that.  </p>  <p>So now I'm stuck at 1 reputation point, unable to cross that 15 rep barrier, and even after posting this question I'll only have 6 rep points and still unable to do anything, and I'll be forced to look for questions to answer. Yes, I should be contributing to the community, but I <em>shouldn't</em> need to begin answering or making questions to upvote questions and answers. This only <strong>spurs more spam/irrelevant</strong> answers if anything. </p>  <p>Very, very, very new-user UNfriendly.</p>

duplicate	Check if a user has an identical open question on another site before allowing them to post<p>There are quite a few sites in the network where content can sometimes overlap. That is, there are questions that could be appropriate on multiple sites in the network. Combine this with the fact that some askers are <em>very</em> eager to get their questions answered, and you can end up with scenarios like this:</p>  <blockquote>   <ul>   <li><p>OP asks question on ELL (34 min ago)</p></li>   <li><p>OP asks same exact question on ELU (32 min ago)</p></li>   <li><p>Someone answers the ELU question (28 min ago)</p></li>   <li><p>Someone answers the ELL question (23 min ago)</p></li>   <li><p>A second person answers the ELL question (21 min ago)</p></li>   <li><p>A moderator on either site (let's say ELL) is tipped off and realizes that an identical question is open <em>and answered</em> on both sites. (19 min ago)</p></li>   <li><p>In the meantime, a second person answers the ELU question (18 min ago)</p></li>   <li><p>Said moderator contacts an ELU mod to determine which site the question should be migrated to for merging. Usually the answer is "the first one it was posted on", but sometimes the question is more appropriate for one site than the other. (17 min ago)</p></li>   <li><p>Moderators agree on destination; duplicate question is migrated to ELL (15 min ago)</p></li>   <li><p>Duplicate is closed and merged so that all the answers appear in one place (13 min ago)</p></li>   <li><p>Users who took the time to answer the question on either site realize that answers had already been posted on the <em>other</em> site and that they quite possibly wasted their time answering in the interim. If the question was migrated away from their site, users realize they have lost rep for that post. (7 min ago)</p></li>   <li><p>It is determined that a whole lot of time and effort has been wasted for everybody (58 seconds ago)</p></li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>The solution? When a user attempts to post a question, <strong><em>check if they have an identical question open on another site</em></strong>. If they do, do not allow them to post it.</p>  <p>This would save a lot of time and effort for everyone involved. Cross-posting identical questions between sites is <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/71938/can-i-cross-post-my-question-from-one-site-to-another/71949#71949">not allowed</a>, and having a feature that disables it would save time on the part of both answerers and moderators. I simply used ELL and ELU as an example because I'm familiar with it; I have a feeling this is an issue on other sites as well, or else the answer about disallowing cross-posting would never have been necessary. </p>  <p>Note that I am <em>not</em> asking that this check include <em>closed questions</em>; if a question has been closed as off topic on one site, it's perfectly acceptable to try and post it on a site where it might be on topic. But if a question is <em>open</em> on one site, it shouldn't also be open on another. We want all the answers in one place and to not waste answerers' time repeating things. </p>  <p>This can get especially hairy because unlike most things moderators deal with, it cannot be accomplished by yourself. You must get in contact with a moderator from the other site—andthat doesn't always take just a few minutes. While you're waiting to discuss the final destination of the question (or if you know it belongs on your site, but can't take care of that because you don't have that migration power) more answers will accumulate on the questions, thus wasting more answerers' time.</p> 	Can we automate detection of cross-posting?<p>How difficult would it be to detect cross-posts when the relevant questions have identical titles and content, and are posted by the same user? As an example:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5699806/optimize-query-in-postgresql">Original, posted on SO</a></li> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5713761/optimize-query-in-postgresql">Following day, migrated to SO from SF</a></li> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5712975/optimize-query-in-postgresql">Also following day, migrated to SO from SU</a></li> </ul>  <p>If this is technically possible,  I'm not sure what the best response would be?</p>  <ol> <li>Notify the user when asking the question that <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/64068/is-cross-posting-a-question-on-multiple-stack-exchange-sites-permitted-if-the-que">cross-posting is not allowed</a>.</li> <li>For <strong>off-topic</strong> cross-posts (e.g. the above example): Let the question be closed as off-topic, and then automatically block or flag the question as an exact duplicate during migration.</li> <li>For <strong>on-topic</strong> cross posts (eg a game programming question on SO and gamedev): Not sure what the process is for flagging/closing cross-posts, but whatever it is, can we automate some aspect of that?</li> <li>Something else?</li> </ol>  <p>(Edited to remove request for auto-detecting same-site re-posting, which has already been implemented since the example I listed occurred)</p>

duplicate	Minor Bug with "Closed Without Comment" Flags<p>With the new close reasons, there is of course the option to close a question with the "custom off topic" reason. When you fill in the box, what you typed as the OT reason gets left as a comment. It seems this gets done <em>right after</em> the "Closed Without Comment" flag is auto-generated, though, because when I do this I immediately get a flag popup on the question telling me I haven't left a comment explaining the closure.  Of course I have; the custom OT box posted my comment. But the flag is generated anyway, so I have to dismiss it.</p>  <p>This isn't a <em>huge</em> bug; it takes me all of a second to dismiss the flag. (Should I tell Community♦ it's being unhelpful, since the flag was incorrect? ;)). But on larger sites where questions might be closed by users more often, I think these invalid flags might pile up in the queue and end up wasting a good amount of a moderator's time. So I thought this was something that The Powers That Be should be aware of :)</p> 	Community ♦ flagging freeform closed posts for comment<p>On beta sites, when a post gets closed without comment, Community ♦ flags it for moderator attention. </p>  <p>Apparently, a comment entered through the freeform close reason doesn't count:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mv0z6.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p><sup>As you can clearly see, there should be no doubt that a comment already exists on the post</sup></p>  <p>Could this be fixed? I don't think it's that important -- I just have to decline the flag, however on larger sites this may lead to a lot of extra flags.</p>

duplicate	Show the post's comments on the "Suggested Edits" review interface<p>Having recently reviewed a few suggested edits, I've found that not being able to see the comments on the post is hindering my understanding of the context of some edits.</p>  <p>In particular, there have been a few posts where someone has made a substantial edit to a question or answer which significantly alters its meaning. Typically I'd reject that as "too radical", since it can't be known that the new meaning of the post was what the original author intended.</p>  <p>However, in some cases it is clear from the comments that the original author is aware of the intended change, and as such the editor is not in fact misrepresenting the author's intentions. In these cases, it would have been useful to see the comments when making the review decision.</p>  <p>As an example, a common cause of this is when an inexperienced user is asked to clarify their question, and ends up writing a comment that would be better off as an edit to the question (due to length, excess code content, etc), presumably due to lack of awareness that the question can be edited. Often, other users will helpfully edit the question to include the information the OP put in the comment (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/1592760">here</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/1606513">here</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/1623088">here</a> for examples). In this situation, it is clear that the edit reflects the OP's intentions, but this information is <em>only</em> present in the comments which are not visible in the review interface.</p>  <p>Following is the <strong>suggested edit</strong> screen showing the suggested edit. It seems indentation is increased and <strong>one line is moved a few lines upwards</strong> and some empty lines added to increase readability. But it look like an invalid edit since changing the related line may cause alteration on the runtime. So not looks lie a valid edit. Better <em>open the answer and examine it</em></p>  <blockquote>   <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HBpJv.png" alt=""></p> </blockquote>  <p>Checking the Q&amp;A itself reveals that a talk had taken place between the OP and the answerer and <strong>revision done by the OP with the permission of the answerer</strong>. <em>So it was indeed a valid edit.</em></p>  <blockquote>   <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SIqYC.png" alt=""></p> </blockquote>  <p>In short: is there any particular reason comments are not displayed in the suggested edit review interface? I think it would add useful contextual information when making review decisions, and presumably this would be trivial to implement.</p>  <p>Note: this is not a dupe of <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/76682">this post</a>, as it does not concern comments posted <em>after</em> the suggested edit.</p> 	Review queue for questions should show comments on question<p>I recently reviewed a suggested edit on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18497779/java-db-constraint">Java DB constraint</a> which simply added a tag to a question.  The comment was "added derby tag based on comment", which surely made sense to the editor, but to check whether the edit was appropriate I had to visit the question in a new window to see the comments.  Would it be reasonable to show the comments on questions and answers in the reviews for suggested edits?</p>  <p>A possible problem with this is that the comments justifying the edit may not make sense if the comments on which they were based are later deleted.</p> 
non-duplicate	Why not put some fun into Stack Exchange?<p>Stack Exchange is about learning. People come and ask about their problems. Others help by answering them. My Question is why Stack Exchange is not planning on adding some fun like games, quizzes and other such competition, where one can test their knowledge?</p> 	Where opinions run free<p>I have seen a number of users get away with opinion based questions on SO. These questions end up closed or put on hold, but they still garner dozens of great, informative answers. I have tried a few time to ask opinion based questions, because I want to draw from the collective experience of the Stack. Sure enough though, these questions get shot down almost immediately. "This is really subjective..." or "Try to make this a yes or no question" is worse then no comment at all. Recently I posted a question on SO. Yes, it was subjective, but I wanted the audience of SO. The audience said it was too subjective, and it should be asked on Programers. The only problem there is, that the people of Programers also said it was too subjective. So, when I do want to gather thoughts from a wealth of experienced programers, with an audience as big as SO, outside of the StackExchange of course, where should I go?</p>

However, the user (now inactive) that posted the question has not selected it (or any other) as the answer.</p>  <p>After looking at "similar questions" while typing this out (e.g. <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/26639/allow-users-to-mark-accepted-answer-on-someone-elses-question">Allow users to mark &quot;accepted&quot; answer on someone else&#39;s question?</a>) , I see that this discussion has come up before. The counter argument is, "That's what voting is for." Back to the c++ question, the first answer, with 4 votes, is that c++ does not permit the desired behavior. Down below (at zero votes until I voted for it) is D.A.'s answer. Clearly, that counter argument only makes sense regarding answers that happened to be submitted at around the same time period, and have had an equal opportunity to receive votes. I would have completely missed the answer if I hadn't spent the extra time to look at the likely-wrong answers. If the site is to be helpful to users (and not just zombie accounts) then it makes sense for these kinds of answers to be marked as accepted so that they will be seen. Voting, in this scenario, is inadequate.</p> 	Allow users to mark "accepted" answer on someone else's question?<p>I have often come upon questions where the asker never bothered accepting what is <strong>obviously</strong> a correct answer. "Obviously" can mean (aside from my own judgment):</p>  <ul> <li><p>The answer is a clear leader in up-votes (again, combined with my judgment that it is a correct one)</p></li> <li><p>The answer is the only one (and again appears correct)</p></li> <li><p>The answer (or Q) is commented on by OP indicating it helped.</p></li> </ul>  <p>If the user is still active on SO, what helps <em>sometimes</em> is to post a comment on the question mentioning you can/should accept the answer. For my own answers, this technique worked ~30-50% of the time.</p>  <p>However, if the user is a zombie (showed up >1 month ago, asked one or few answers, and was not on the site for >1 month since), this would obviously not work.</p>  <p>To ameliorate this situation, I would propose allowing users whose rep > <em>threshold</em> to "accept" answers from other peoples questions. This would be limited to:</p>  <ul> <li><p>questions from zombie users as defined above (e.g. total active time on site &lt;= 30% of time since last visit, or however you want to define).</p></li> <li><p>questions from non-zombie users with very low accept rates (this may require higher threshold).</p></li> </ul>  <p>In either case,</p>  <ul> <li><p>neither the OP nor "guest acceptor" gains 2 points for accepting.</p></li> <li><p>the OP should have the right to choose a different accepted answer at any time, and get 2 points rep when that happens.</p></li> <li><p>If you accept your own answer, you obviously don't get 15rep for acceptance.</p></li> </ul>  <p>I think if implemented to the above specs, it should provide enough of a barrier to misuse while serving the goal of the site (allow arriving at the best possible answer).</p>  <p>P.S. This was obviously triggered by some of my own answers but once I realized the situation I observed it numerously with questions I was merely browsing.</p>

My post wasn't offensive or against any rules (to my knowledge), it was rather tongue in cheek, was being edited to elaborate with more content <em>and</em> the joke would have been edited out reasonably quickly by myself (I'm not really one to intentionally make a post anything that it shouldn't be.)</p>  <p>The deleted post can be <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7093651/why-is-a-task-continuation-for-a-child-task-not-triggered-when-parent-is-cancelle/7093843#7093843">found here</a>, obviously you'll notice the <code>t</code> prefixes on words of the first sentence, this was in jest to all the <code>t</code> prefixes in the sample code - not really funny at time time, let alone in hindsight, but I just did it, and would have come around to my senses in a couple of minutes or so.</p>  <p>What is slightly frustrating, and perhaps the only thing that actually drew me here to post, was that the comment added didn't explicitly tell me <em>why</em>, but rather hypocritically took the approach of mocking me with prefixes of <code>t</code> on each word, and an inaccurate assumption (which I can actually see as a <em>joke</em> by that person) of why my posts ended up in that format... they seemed to miss the point that <em>mine</em> was, in fact, a joke. Lastly, the post was one single line, but yet informative with two very relevant links (i.e. good content) which could have been edited correctly in a matter of seconds. I've seen worse 'serious' answers, in fact, I do daily, and they go nowhere - often times people put the effort in to edit them if needs be. A simple comment by such a 'responsible' member would have no doubt urged to see the light sooner, had I not already. </p>  <p>I can pretty much think ahead before posting this that nobody will necessarily disagree with the action taken (at least not onymously) but I am interested in thoughts, and obviously answers to my question, and preferably (though not really pressing, I'm not too concerned about a single answer and believe more is at stake than <em>it</em>) my answer reinstated. I participate quite actively throughout the network, and it is pretty discomforting, and perplexing when seemingly double standards are applied with overzealous moderation.</p> 	Is there a web call or some sort of meta api to get all new comments in the last N hours?<p>Is there an undocumented web call or some sort of meta API to get all new comments globally in the last N hours? </p>

duplicate	The Ability to Hide Questions<p>I was wondering how hard it would be to enable a 'hiding' option that let me hide certain questions that I don't want to see. That way if it was a very active question that I have no interest in, I could simply click hide and not see it anymore.</p>  <p>The only foreseeable reason why this couldn't be implemented completely with a Greasemonkey script is that it would be nice to get replacement posts. As of right now, even the hide tag feature simply hides the questions after they were loaded. If I hid a lot of tags, I would end up getting very few questions on the home page.</p>  <p>This is, of course, due to caching.</p> 	"Sick of this question" button<p>I find SE an amazingly well thought-out platform in so many respects, so I am a bit puzzled that what I am about to describe has not been solved/addressed yet.</p>  <p>I can specify my interests by keeping a list of tags that I want to follow. However, on the "my tags" unanswered tab (or on any other tab for that matter) I can not choose how the questions are ranked. They seem to be roughly ranked by descending number of votes, with occasionally some fresh stuff thrown in at the top.</p>  <p>As a result, much of this list feels quite stale, since it is made up of questions that have been collecting votes (and dust) for a while.</p>  <p>Hence my request: I would like to be able to click "I'm bored with this question, please don't show it to me for a while." so that my list actually fills up with things I haven't looked at or am not bored with yet, and I don't have to wade through screenfuls of oldtimers to detect a newcomer.</p>  <p>One variation could be "I'm bored with this question, please hide it until someone comes up with an answer of at least 3 upvotes".</p>

Any way to find out the total number of questions I have viewed (either total or unique)?</p> 	Is it "good" to ask a question whose answer you already know, and not to auto-answer it but rather let people think about it?<p>I got the SO virus a month ago or so, and now it is kind of a reflex for me to search the questions database when I am blocked or in doubt.</p>  <p>There are also situations where i find and solve by myself a nasty bug which i think could have impacted other people, and which probably will in the future.</p>  <p>In such cases, is it considered "in the spirit" of the site to ask the question as if I didn't solve the bug, as a challenge for motivated SO users to search for a best solution or to find the nasty cause of the problem ?</p>  <p>Of course it could be seen as "wasting" time of the answerers, but I think it has some advantages over simply answering your own question. You get possibly better quality answers and more diverse opinions, which will help future users who search for the bug's solution ; you make people think about the problem, and in the end I feel that this is what SO is about - sharing your knowledge while training yourself in recognizing and solving problems, and getting handy at explaining them.</p>  <p>What do you think? Should I simply auto-answer my question, or leave it open for motivated users to find the trick?</p>

duplicate	How can I cancel an edit I made on another user's question or answer?<p>Edits made by users who do not have edit privileges are placed in a queue until it is peer reviewed.</p>  <p>E.g., I edited someone else's answer. but changed my mind. If I'd edited my own question/answer, there would be a "Rollback" button, but there's no such button in the scenario I'm describing (at least none that I can see).</p>  <p><strong>Is there a way to remove one's edit from the peer review queue</strong>?</p> 	How to revoke a suggested edit?<p>While trying to update (by editing) my answer, I accidentally edited another answer and submitted the edit. A message told me that the edit wouldn't be visible until it was peer reviewed.</p>  <p>How  can I revoke the edit I made?</p>

When visiting my own profile page (but not that of other people) it looks as follows.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gXLTC.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>The helpful flags count has disappeared as well as the information about consecutive visits. I don't see this on my profile on other sites.</p>

non-duplicate	Where is most appropriate for Cloudfoundry server admin questions?<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13252730/nats-error-unresponsive-client-detected-connection-dropped">This question</a> is probably a server administration question than a development one.  Would ServerFault be more appropriate (as I have suggested to the OP), given the current lack of any kind of cloud.stackexchange.com?</p>  <p>If there is a more appropriate location than stackoverflow.com, Cloud Foundry should get a heads-up, as they currently <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.com/getinvolved" rel="nofollow">push</a> <em>all</em> questions to either Twitter or the main SO site.  Maybe them adding a second link to a <em>cloudfoundry</em> tag on ServerFault (or wherever is more appropriate) would be advisable.</p> 	I cannot leave a comment now<p>I could already add comments, but now I can't. I am using Firefox 11.0, tried to use IE9 but the problem persists</p> 
non-duplicate	Mod vs. Users close war<p>A moderator closed a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21494805/computer-addressing-in-a-word-organized-physical-memory">recent question</a> as off-topic. A few users disputed the close, believing it to be based on a misunderstanding of the question. (The moderator's comment before closing said to look up big-endian vs. little-endian, which has nothing to do with the question.) The mod reopened and reclosed the question, wiping the reopen votes. The mod also deleted his initial comment and the comments disputing the close.</p>  <p>Is this a valid use of mod powers? In a case like this, is the moderator supposed to have the final say on whether the question stays closed? The fact that we can vote against a mod close vote suggests that those votes are supposed to count, but the fact that the mod can override them suggests maybe not.</p> 	Network wide activity feeds?<p>On individual sites, per user RSS and API feeds are available in addition to the activity profile tab. On global profiles, though, the only activity feed available is via the web interface. Could SE-wide activity feeds be made available via RSS and the API?</p>

duplicate	Mark as copied answer<p>Sometimes when I post an answer someone posts the same answer. But I think this is a problem at all. There are two way while this could happen:</p>  <ol> <li>Post nearly at the same time. (No problem, could happen) </li> <li>Straight copy the answer and write it was your own. (NOT community conform)</li> </ol>  <p>I think there could be a new way to handle such happenings. The first point can be threaded with a f.e. handshake of both answerers, where they can approve each other as same but not copied answer and divide the reputation ( <em>only my suggestion ;)</em> ) </p>  <p>But I think <strong>the more problematic way</strong> is the second where someone <strong>only copy-paste</strong> the answer to get his answer on top of the answer list (<em>actives and new ones are on top</em>) and the person who asked the question mark this pasted answer as "Answer". </p>  <p>Is there a way to mark such copy-paste actions as "Copied Answer"?</p> 	What to do about Copy Cat answers?<p>I know a lot of people really want to get lots of SO rep points to improve their quality of life. I get it. When I read a question, I think about whether I know the answer or not. If yes, then I take the time to write up what I deem to be a reasonable answer. If not, then I think about whether or not I want to try to figure it out. If so, and if I do, then I repeat the "know the answer" step. I don't try to flash answer questions. I'm just not the type.</p>  <p>But what's bugging me lately is the copy cat answerer. I read a question. Think. Formulate an answer. Then answer. This takes at least a few minutes. Four times this week, about 5-10 minutes after I post my answer (which comes 10 or more minutes after the question is posted), someone else posts the exact same answer! Even the same code with the same variable names! That's annoying. I don't really know why it bugs me so much, but there you have it. I'm annoyed. </p>  <p>In my annoyance, I feel like voting the answer down. But technically it's a correct answer, so I shouldn't do that. Maybe I should leave a comment? Maybe I should let it go? Probably the latter. Then again, duplicate questions are closed, why not close duplicate answers? Any suggestions?</p>

I know - shame on me]).</p>  <p>That answer, IMHO, deserved a lot more than 25 rep points I could give - I'd have gladly given a post-factum bounty to the person who provided this insight.</p>  <p>So the questions are:</p>  <ul> <li><p>is there such a mechanism on SO? </p></li> <li><p>If no, do you consider it a good idea to add? </p></li> <li><p>If good idea, how easy/difficult would it be?</p></li> </ul>  <p>Thanks</p> 
duplicate	Add advanced search options to the help pages<p>I was attempting to guide a new user into using the advanced search options today but realised that you can't do it from the Advanced Search Tips link on the search page itself (as it is collapsed by default).

non-duplicate	Uncontrolled and excessive downvote punishment to feedback posts<p>Supposedly someone gives a <strong>feedback</strong> on MSO pertaining to SE web-application (addressing to SE developers). Then <em>other</em> MSO users think that its not constructive or not worth the effort, they will show their concern (<a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/138119">with snarkiness or otherwise</a>) in the comments. They might down vote OP and move on.</p>  <p>If the disagreeing user happens to be more credible than the OP, most of the visiting users will follow his/her lead and start down voting the OP (probably just for the fun?). Moreover, it seems like the forthcoming users won't bother to read the comment/justification by the OP (even if the OP is able to addressed the concern or even negate the critic's point-of-view with proof). They will just shoot -1 to OP and +1 for critic's comment.</p>  <p>In other words:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Mr.A has identified and reported a legit problem in SO system.</p>      <p>Mr.B thinks, its not necessary due to XYZ reason ("<em>its very petty/its very unlikely/its a waste of time and effort</em>"), so he post a comment and down vote.</p>      <p><strong>Scenario A:</strong> </p>      <p>Mr.A argues with ABC reason which evidently answers the XYZ ("<em>here is a solution, it requires a very less effort probably a copy/paste</em>").</p>      <p>Mr.B never admitted or denied, but the following visitors will follow the set pattern, downvote Mr.A (until his negative scale is exhausted) while upvoting Mr.B's comment even he was <em>owned</em> by Mr.B.</p>      <p><strong>Scenario B:</strong></p>      <p>Mr.A considered Mr.B's point is valid and closed the question.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Normally feedback is supposed to be <em>'either take it or take a pass'</em>. Exploiting and start bashing the person giving feedback and convert it into a dispute (or even personal vendetta) is certainly not a very sane idea and it looks very unpleasant <em>unless</em> it is so affirmative that "if someone doesn't agree with your idea, then you can't argue with them unless you are equally reputed (here on meta)".</p>  <p>To avoid this puzzlement/ugliness, should there a separate <em>view</em> for the feedback posts with <em>no negative vote option</em>? In my opinion, when the dev team members review and decide that a feedback's worth a try or not (on the basis of feedback itself, votes-if-any, comments and justifications), they may update its status (probably by tagging it?) accordingly; Active, Under Review, Started, Closed, Won't Fix.. (similar to uservoice.com?)</p> 	Search Input Control Should Retain Search String<p>The text input control (top right) should retain its value when used. Thus making it much easier to modify the search.</p>  <p>Currently one has to completely re-enter (with all typo likelihood), or navigate back (thus losing the initial results as reference.</p>  <p>EDIT: JUst tried again on SF. Search for "[windows]" consistently left a blank search box... some other searches left it populated and some didn't. There seems to be a lack on consistency. (All in FF.)</p>  <p>EDIT #2: As noted in the <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/22794">answer below</a> if the search consists of just tags, then it is treated as selecting those tags. This should still leave the search box populated to allow refinement of the search (i.e. keep the page content consistent with a search).</p>

non-duplicate	How do I get back to a self-deleted question?<p>Yesterday I wrote (in a hurry) an admittedly bad question. Now I have a better question to ask, and it's related to what I already wrote.</p>  <p>Is there a way I can go back to that question so I can undelete and edit it, instead of sucking it up and holding the automatic downvote in my bag?</p> 	How to answer any language + language's framework questions?<p>Ok, so I read <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/129556/appropriate-level-of-contextual-information-in-stack-overflow-questions">Appropriate level of contextual information in Stack Overflow questions</a> on this very site, and I really think it is a little bit more general and different from what I'm wondering.</p>  <h3>The basic situation</h3>  <p>User "A" asks a question for a specific part of some framework for a programming language, e.g. jQuery question, which is in fact always related to JavaScript: syntax, variables, etc. The user is a novice to the programming framework (this is assumed from the level of difficulty of the question), but has knowledge in the programming language (he knows Javascript, but he is new to jQuery).</p>  <h3>Demonstrative Question</h3>  <p>How can I place optional (to be called only if set as parameter) callback in my $.ajax function?</p>  <h3>Demonstrative Answer v.1</h3>  <pre><code>var ajax = function(url, callback) {     $.ajax({         url: url,         success: typeof(callback) === 'function' ? callback : undefined }); } </code></pre>  <p>Here I'm using basic JavaScript language method, but in fact in the framework exists specific functions for exactly the same manipulation (as in my answer v.2). By this answer the user perhaps will understand better that the callback of every event has to be just a regular function (because he knows JavaScript, and doesn't know jQuery as much, this answer will be clearer for him).</p>  <h3>Demonstrative Answer v.2</h3>  <pre><code>var ajax = function(url, callback) {     $.ajax({         url: url,         success: $.isFunction(callback) ? callback : undefined }); } </code></pre>  <p>Here I'm using the native <code>$.isFunction()</code> which is part of the framework he is learning and it might ( or not ? ) be better to learn the other utils that the framework gives along with the general question that has been asked.</p>  <h2>The general meta-question, regarding my answer</h2>  <ol> <li><p>What is the best way (in level of deepness and context) to answer such a question, regarding the connection between the framework and the language?</p></li> <li><p>Is it better to place your examples with as much native language code or more framework-oriented code (talking about questions from novice of the framework users)?</p></li> </ol>  <p>This question came up to me while answering this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10410167/how-to-call-models-method-from-collection-in-backbone-js/10414096#comment13437773_10414096">How to call model&#39;s method from collection in backbone.js?</a> and it came up as a discussion with another answerer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/10414096/1282674">in the comments</a>.</p> 
duplicate	Show the post's comments on the "Suggested Edits" review interface<p>Having recently reviewed a few suggested edits, I've found that not being able to see the comments on the post is hindering my understanding of the context of some edits.</p>  <p>In particular, there have been a few posts where someone has made a substantial edit to a question or answer which significantly alters its meaning. Typically I'd reject that as "too radical", since it can't be known that the new meaning of the post was what the original author intended.</p>  <p>However, in some cases it is clear from the comments that the original author is aware of the intended change, and as such the editor is not in fact misrepresenting the author's intentions. In these cases, it would have been useful to see the comments when making the review decision.</p>  <p>As an example, a common cause of this is when an inexperienced user is asked to clarify their question, and ends up writing a comment that would be better off as an edit to the question (due to length, excess code content, etc), presumably due to lack of awareness that the question can be edited. Often, other users will helpfully edit the question to include the information the OP put in the comment (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/1592760">here</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/1606513">here</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/1623088">here</a> for examples). In this situation, it is clear that the edit reflects the OP's intentions, but this information is <em>only</em> present in the comments which are not visible in the review interface.</p>  <p>Following is the <strong>suggested edit</strong> screen showing the suggested edit. It seems indentation is increased and <strong>one line is moved a few lines upwards</strong> and some empty lines added to increase readability. But it look like an invalid edit since changing the related line may cause alteration on the runtime. So not looks lie a valid edit. Better <em>open the answer and examine it</em></p>  <blockquote>   <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HBpJv.png" alt=""></p> </blockquote>  <p>Checking the Q&amp;A itself reveals that a talk had taken place between the OP and the answerer and <strong>revision done by the OP with the permission of the answerer</strong>. <em>So it was indeed a valid edit.</em></p>  <blockquote>   <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SIqYC.png" alt=""></p> </blockquote>  <p>In short: is there any particular reason comments are not displayed in the suggested edit review interface? I think it would add useful contextual information when making review decisions, and presumably this would be trivial to implement.</p>  <p>Note: this is not a dupe of <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/76682">this post</a>, as it does not concern comments posted <em>after</em> the suggested edit.</p> 	Show comments while suggesting edits or reviewing first posts<p>In the first post queue, I see a question where the asker posted important supplemental information in two comments. So I click “edit”, and the comments disappear: all that's left is the standalone editor, with no link to the post, no comments, nothing but the title, body and tag edit boxes.</p>  <p>To get the comment text, I need to open the same URL in a different tab, and copy the comments across tabs. That's not as efficient as it could and should be.</p>  <p>The same issue arises when suggesting an edit from the post itself: the out-of-page editor doesn't show the comments, and doesn't have a link to the page. <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/150142/show-the-posts-comments-on-the-suggested-edits-review-interface">Same thing when reviewing suggested edits.</a></p>  <p>Please always show the comments while editing a post.</p>

The question probably contains a snippet of <em>sloppy</em> but not quite <em>awful</em> code; code indicating that the author, typically a new/low-rep user, possibly a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2004/03/02/82840.aspx" rel="nofollow">Mort</a>, doesn't really know what he's doing.

The goal and problem are both clearly stated.  The code is formatted (sort of).  Mort was polite and checked his spelling.  The question looks <em>answerable</em>, although from a rep perspective<sup>*</sup> it's an obvious dead-end, it's had maybe 3 views in the past 30 minutes.</p></li> <li><p>So you decide, <em>you know what, this person took the time to write up the question properly, he deserves an answer</em>, put on your good citizen hat and throw him a bone.  You slog through the ugly code, find the offending line, direct his attention to it and explain why it's wrong and how it needs to be fixed.</p></li> <li><p>Later, he leaves a comment saying that yes, that was indeed the problem and your answer helped him fix it <em>(great!)</em>.  Oh, but, now there's another problem <em>(uh-oh...)</em>. Something else is broken.  After letting out a long sigh, you read the comment and/or edited question, roll up your sleeves, and write up Take 2, hoping that's the end of it.</p></li> <li><p>And of <em>course</em> it's not the end.  Now maybe the error is gone, but it's not doing what it's supposed to.  If you're anything like me, your patience is now starting to wear thin. It's lousy code and you didn't volunteer to help him rewrite his whole app.  And of course, the question still only has 12 views, and nobody has upvoted either the question or your answer, <em>including the person you're helping</em>, so this is turning out to be a genuinely thankless task in all respects.

Now the question is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/posts/18334315/revisions">edited</a> to a completely different question and the answer is completely out of context. Now in a scenario with multiple answers/ and or very few days to award the bounty - if the question is changed then the thread becomes pretty irrelevant and the bounty pretty much becomes useless. Is this by design or is there a peer review for bounty question edits? </p>

Most of these edits get rejected as "invalid edit" or "radical change", but sometimes these edits are useful (and of course, sometimes they are not). For code edits, only the OP can decide whether the edit is useful or not, so I suggest that when someone suggests an edit, (s)he can choose whether everyone can approve/reject the edit, or only the OP.

It just fixes some capitalization and nothing else &mdash; no grammar fixes, no sentence restructuring to make it more clear, no code formatting, no dividing it into lists, etc. &mdash; in short, perfect candidate to be rejected.</p>  <p><sub>(The image for the suggested-edit I have uploaded didn't have those problems - however, there were those problems in the edits that I encountered earlier.)</sub></p>  <p>The problem before me is that I am helpless. I can't approve, reject or improve the edit since I have already gone past my daily quota of Reviewing them. Neither can I make the edits to the post since this suggested edit is pending review. I am completely helpless!!</p>  <h2>Whats the opinion of the community in this matter?</h2>  <ul> <li><p>Should we (those with more than 2000 Rep) be able to edit them? Don't count it in our Review Progress obviously - not sure what should be done with the suggested edit already proposed.</p></li> <li><p>Or, Let it be, someone else would come and edit them and other Reviewers would deal with the Suggested Edit appropriately.</p></li> <li><p>Or, Something else.</p></li> </ul>  <hr>  <h3>Note:</h3>  <p>This might not be much of a problem for Stack Overflow since the Review Queue is very busy here. However, this is a bit of a problem for smaller sites. So, treat it as a question posted at Meta.SE and not so much at Meta.SO. </p>  <hr>  <h3>Dirty Hack:</h3>  <p>Ah... found a dirty hack to work around this situation. However, this shouldn't be used unless absolutely necessary. Credit goes to <a href="http://meta.unix.stackexchange.com/users/885/gilles">@Gilles</a> in <a href="http://meta.unix.stackexchange.com/questions/1151/why-cant-i-edit-a-question-i-have-reviewed#comment1677_1151">this comment</a>.</p>  <p>To edit a post enter this link in your browser: <code>http://${site_url}/posts/${post_id}/edit</code>. So, to edit this particular post one would enter: <code>http://meta.stackoverflow.com/posts/171129/edit</code>.</p>  <p>I repeat, the hack shouldn't be used unless necessary.</p> 	Edit question with pending edits but can't accept edit<p>I want to edit (retag) a question with an edit pending. Normally, I would just review/accept/improve the pending edit, but I've already hit my review limit for the next couple of hours. Is there any way to still get around the pending edit, or do I just have to wait until somebody else reviews the edit?</p> 
duplicate	Remove the synonym mapping [generic-programming] to [generics]<p>"Generics" refers to a language features in C#, Java, and several other languages.</p>  <p>Generic programming typically refers to a programming paradigm used in C++ (as well as in a handful other languages, where it relies on other equivalent language features), where it relies on templates (not generics) and the ability to create specializations for specific types.</p>  <p>They really have nothing in common, other than that both involve syntax with lots of angle brackets. One is a programming paradigm just like functional programming or object-oriented programming, while the other is a language construct found in specific languages.</p> 	I get unrelated [tag:generics] tagged Q in my inbox via [tag:generic-programming] subscription<p>But these tags are about different things. Usually <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/generics" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'generics'" rel="tag">generics</a> are for .NET specific syntax/asage Q, but <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/generic-programming" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'generic-programming'" rel="tag">generic-programming</a> is for generic algorithms and design patterns. </p>  <p>The problem is I don't want to receive .Net Q notifications because this is not what I have subscribed for.

non-duplicate	Close alt not changed on close operation<p>Before voting to close my own question, it shows </p>  <pre><code>close(2) and alt message as "2 more vote to close this question" </code></pre>  <p>This doesn't change even after I voted to close my question. But it just change after I refreshed. So is this a bug?</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Alt message doesn't change even after I voted to close my question. But it just change after I refreshed. So is this a bug?</p> 	Why do downvotes detract reputation from poster on meta?<p>I read somewhere that downvotes on meta simply means that someone doesn't agree with you. But on Stack Overflow, downvotes typically mean the question is low quality or off topic. I completely understand why downvotes detract reputation from the poster (whose post is being downvoted) on Stack Overflow, but I don't understand it here.</p>  <p>I understand that all voting is subjective, but I feel that on meta, voting is purposefully subjective - Hence the <a href="/questions/tagged/discussion" class="post-tag required-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;discussion&#39;" rel="tag">discussion</a> tag. </p>  <p>Could somebody explain the philosophy behind detracting reputation from users whose meta posts are downvoted?</p> 
non-duplicate	In question lists, some of the question body previews wrap strangely<p>I just noticed the following question appears slightly odd in Firefox 3.5. Note "them." is the only text on the second line, so it appears in a rather odd location. (I expect it would wrap to be under the word "For" like all other questions.)</p>  <p>Using IE6, however, this displays correctly.</p>  <p><img src="http://img405.imageshack.us/img405/6790/sostrange.jpg"> <sub>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)</sub></p>  <p>Anyone else see (or not see) this?</p> 	Community flags a closed question as commentless after a comment from an off-topic closure<p>When a moderator closes a question on a beta site, if there is no comment on the question, Community raises a flag:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Please explain the nature of this closed question via a comment</p> </blockquote>  <p>This happens even when the question was closed as off-topic with a custom comment. Obviously, in that case, there is a comment — the flag indicator even says so. So Community should not raise this flag.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zRdNh.png" alt="screenshot"></p> 
non-duplicate	Malicious ads or just simple error messages?<p>I was looking at a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket" rel="nofollow">WebSocket</a> issue when I noticed these two error messages as I loaded Stack&nbsp;Overflow. I was using a Windows&nbsp;7 machine running Google Chrome.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Blocked a frame with origin "<a href="http://view.atdmt.com" rel="nofollow">http://view.atdmt.com</a>" from accessing a frame with origin "<a href="http://stackoverflow.com">http://stackoverflow.com</a>".

Protocols, domains, and ports must match."</p> </blockquote>  <p>Were these ads trying to escape their area or was it just a simple mistake from one of their scripts? Are these ads malicious because they were trying to access cross domain scope with their scripts?</p>  <h3>Edit</h3>  <p>I was able to reproduce this several times. The path I took was to click "Ask Question" on Meta&nbsp;Stack&nbsp;Overflow. Type in a few things to satisfy the 15 character requirement (not sure if the text part mattered) and then I clicked on "main". The ad was present, and so were the errors, the HTML shown in my answer, and the scrips loaded.</p>  <p>I must have got lucky in the reproduction, because after about 11 refreshes I was able to get the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azure_Services_Platform" rel="nofollow">Windows Azure</a> ad to show up on stackoverflow.com. Along with the ad were the errors.</p>  <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator" rel="nofollow">URL</a> that I copied by right clicking on the ad itself was</p>  <pre><code>http://clk.atdmt.com/go/451838910/direct;ai.337359372;ct.1/01 </code></pre>  <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/G9YGfcJ.png" alt="Advertisement view"></p> 	I want my Stack Overflow newsletter to be filtered by my favorite filters<blockquote>   <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>   <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/110902/can-we-have-newsletters-that-take-into-account-favorite-tags">Can we have newsletters that take into account favorite tags?</a>  </p> </blockquote>    <p>I know you can get emails about specific filters but:</p>  <ol> <li>I do not want to get them everyday and</li> <li>I don't want to see every question, I want to see the interesting ones like in the newsletter.</li> </ol>  <p>Most of the questions I see in the newsletter cover topics I have no interest in.

non-duplicate	Permanent Flag Weight History Link on User Profile<p>The link to the user's flagging history should always be available to them (but not to the public) in their profile.</p>  <p>Example for my profile: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/flag-weight/146610">Flagging History</a></p>  <p>At the moment, the link isn't displayed when the user's flag weight is 100, so they can't see feedback if they happen to have made an equal number of helpful and declined flags: the weight is invisible and so the link doesn't appear.</p> 	How should we deal with human factor based race conditions, with regards to accidental edits?<p><sub>(disclaimer: a quick search for "accidental edit" did not bring up anything useful IMO, but I don't think that this is an uncommon problem -- if there's a dupe, CVs are welcome.)</sub></p>  <p>So, here is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/posts/21073459/revisions">the revision history of this question</a>. As you can see, the original post was pretty badly worded with quite a few typos and spelling errors. Those have been fixed by user Suin, but I didn't find his changes substantial enough, so I have also opted to edit the post, trimming the trailing "thanks".</p>  <p>However, in the meantime the OP has changed his post as well, and by the time I hit Submit, OP's edits have already been committed. So my edit has undone those. This is bad, because the edits improved the post (he clarified his question), and I didn't want to vandalize that. What's even worse, I didn't have any notification or warning as to what was happening.</p>  <p>I remember having done the same a couple of times before, and I've always managed to restore OP's edits manually, by looking at the revisions, but this sort of manual merge is tedious and the day has come when I've got fed up with it.</p>  <p>So my questions are:</p>  <ul> <li>What should I do to avoid these situations?</li> <li>What should I do when I accidentally run into such a case?</li> <li>Could some sort of improvement be made to the site so that users who are currently editing a post can get notified if parallel modifications occur?</li> </ul> 
non-duplicate	Why was the question "parameters and coding", which consisted solely of that title and an error message, deleted? <p>I'm talking about the following question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10480605/parameters-and-coding/">parameters and coding</a></p>  <p>I answered that question properly, and received 5 up-votes for my trouble, only to see the question deleted!</p>  <p>I don't know what the reason for this could be... Surely there must be an alternative? Locking, perhaps?</p>  <p>When the effort expended answering a question can be wasted via such deletion, what purpose does it serve? How can I possibly determine which questions are worth answering?</p>  <p>I believe that question was correct, and merely poorly formatted and lacking all semblance of context apart from that contained in the error details and tags... However, these details alone were sufficient for me to answer!</p> 	tag merge: multi-tenant, multi-tenancy and multitenancy<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/multi-tenant" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'multi-tenant'" rel="tag">multi-tenant</a> is by far the most popular so I think it should be the only one, with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/multitenancy" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'multitenancy'" rel="tag">multitenancy</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/multi-tenancy" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'multi-tenancy'" rel="tag">multi-tenancy</a> as synonyms</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13583947/administration-of-a-multi-tenant-rails-app">Administration of a Multi-Tenant Rails App</a> is a classic, with all 3 tags...</p>  <p>A single tag would really help me right now to search for [django] [multi-tenant]</p> 
non-duplicate	Stack Overflow training guide - a video maybe?<p>Whilst trawling through the new review feature a common theme I see in posts are:</p>  <ul> <li>broken code formatting (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4658225">PHP GET problem - no form $_GET data is present</a>)</li> <li>wall of code</li> </ul>  <p>I know this was suggested some time back and was downvoted (<a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/40214/please-provide-some-quick-how-to-and-training-videos-for-the-sites">Please provide some quick how to and training videos for the sites</a>) but it was never ever <code>status-declined</code>.</p>  <p>To its credit Stack Overflow et al makes it totally frictionless and simple to ask a question, but a recurring theme I see so often is where people just don't seem to grok code formatting. They don't seem to understand that when they paste in a block of code that's legitimately tab indented in their IDE it'll most likely end up in the wrong place in the SO editor.</p>  <p>I think a short five minute video tour emphasising key features such as this would perhaps be useful. So when new users ask a question for the first time we push a link to said video(s) on the "How to ask" intro and after they asked their first two or three questions.</p>  <p>I and many others spend a lot of time reformatting code just so we can begin to understand a question. A short slick education video might grease the wheels of understanding because clearly people aren't reading the editor formatting help.</p>  <p>Maybe a video isn't the answer, maybe some way to do a "Clippy" type "It looks like you've pasted some code..." popup to draw attention to the formatting tools and editing help. Or maybe implement an automatic tab stripper?</p> 	Show a short link for Answers too... not just Questions<p>Currently, when you hover over the <code>link</code> link for a question you see a shortlink.</p>  <p>For example for <strong><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3664462/ajax-inconsistency-in-ie-8">this question</a></strong>, hovering over the <code>link</code> for the question shows you:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>http://stackoverflow.com/q/3664462/[USER_ID]</p> </blockquote>  <p>and the title displays <code>short permalink to this question</code></p>  <p>Whereas hovering over the <code>link</code> for an answer for the same question shows you</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3664462/ajax-inconsistency-in-ie-8/3664482#3664482">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3664462/ajax-inconsistency-in-ie-8/3664482#3664482</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>and the title displays <code>permalink to this answer</code></p>  <p>I think it'd be very convenient to provide a short permalink to the answers too. For example the above answer can also be linked to by simply using</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/3664482">http://stackoverflow.com/q/3664482</a></p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>As Jon Seigel pointed out in the answers, the above takes you directly to the Answer, and it's just as short as the question link.</strong> Also, the User ID could be tacked on.</p>  <p>Providing this as the answer <code>link</code> seems more consistent to me.</p>  <p><strong>Visual aids:</strong></p>  <p><em>Question:</em></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/j97XU.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>  <p><em>Answer:</em></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/abm61.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>

Is there some way to describe the magic of how the design of the Stack Exchange system actually produces useful results very quickly? I can describe generally that it is a Q&amp;A site that users vote on the answers, but Stack Overflow feels like so much more. Am I perhaps thinking too big about this?</p> 	Is there an elevator pitch for the SE Network?<p>I meet a lot of people regularly who have the knowledge and interest to participate in various SE communities however, many a time they do not know of SE, or of the existence of any site beyond Stack Overflow.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BULWU.jpg" alt=""></p>  <p>So, in such cases, what would be a good <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/stack-exchange-naming-for-dummies/">elevator pitch</a> that would make them log on to Stack Exchange and explore the Network?</p>

duplicate	Advice on rehabilitating an unpopular Meta question (or not)<p>I recently submitted an <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/193762/should-downvote-without-comment-rate-remain-unpublished">MSO discussion question</a>. In very short order it has been downvoted to the point where it appears on the rogues gallery of downvoted questions (i.e. the last page of questions sorted by votes, with 50 per page). It also has by far the worst net-votes-to-total-views rating of all questions on that last page, which could be worst of all questions. Finally, although I can't see up/down vote totals for other questions with my rep, the fact that the question only has one upvote probably puts it in the running for worst up/down vote ratio amongst high net-downvoted questions.</p>  <p>While there are a few questions on the last page that might cause me to view my membership there as a badge of honor (e.g. <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/42601/should-we-have-a-policy-about-too-much-downvoting">Should we have a policy about &quot;too much downvoting&quot;?</a>), I would, if possible, like to "improve the question".

I know I shouldn't radically change the question as that would violate SE's rules of integrity, but wanted to get your thoughts on the reasonableness of any of the following:</p>  <ul> <li>Change the title to fit MSO's convention of highlighting the key change under discussion rather than the twisted form of maintaining the status quo that is there now (ironically done in an attempt to avoid controversy)</li> <li>Remove the update about "agreement voting" not being allowed for discussion questions on the grounds that people don't like being lectured to, particularly from a relative newcomer and particularly about something that's been accepted practice for a long time</li> <li>Add an update which summarizes all the reasons why the embedded idea was a bad one</li> <li>Include a link to the popular <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/135/encouraging-people-to-explain-downvotes">Encouraging people to explain downvotes</a> to emphasize that I've read that post as part of my research</li> <li>Leave the question alone and let it die, on the grounds that any more modifications at this point would be viewed as pandering and would be considered unwelcome</li> </ul> 	The "I Get It" Reputation Problem<p>I wrote a question about blocking certain characters in passwords. It became tremendously unpopular, and it seemed like everyone wanted to rain on my parade every day.</p>  <p>Eventually, I "got it," agreed completely with what people were saying to me, and just wanted to withdraw my question so that my reputation didn't slide even further downhill.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, the system is designed such that I can't withdraw my question or redeem myself. Instead, I just get daily reputation attacks. That's a terrible system, and it needs to be changed.</p> 
duplicate	Reputation Activity in User Dropdown Incorrect/Inconsistent?<p>I hope this isn't a duplicate.  Similar questions that I found are over a year old.</p>  <p>I have seen cases where shortly after an upvote (perhaps on an old answer?), the summary in my user activity dropdown shows inconsistent counts:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0KvQD.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>Particularly, the <code>Slid a div offscreen using jQuery</code> answer shows <code>+40</code>, when it was only updated once yesterday.

I'm not really sure how this would fit in with the current structure of SE. </p>  <p>Oftentimes after asking a question, maybe after an hour or so, I end up finding the answer I needed somewhere. And it comes time for me to answer the most difficult question of all: do I delete this question, or do I keep it in case someone answers and others may benefit from it. The problem is, if I don't delete it and no one answers, my acceptance rate goes down. So usually I'll just delete it.</p>  <p>However, sometimes I fear that someone is typing a really really long answer to my question since itäs only been an hour, and so I imagine the nightmare that person experiences when they find out their essay will be gone to waste. Overall, this never-to-be-seen-again answer could have benefitted many people had the question remained.</p>  <p>Since SE has gone "live-happy" lately, where answers and comments refresh live, I thought it might be interesting if the original asker of the question (or anyone else for that matter) could see how many people are currently responding to the question (just count, not necessary to display their names). This way, if I know someone is replying, I won't delete the question, and others can benefit from it. </p> 	Add support for OS X 10.9 Safari Push Notifications<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/notifications/safari-push-notifications/" rel="nofollow">Apple's page</a> has a nice summary of the feature:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>OS X Mavericks introduces a powerful new way to keep users engaged with your website.

Safari Push Notifications work just like push notifications for apps. They display your website icon and notification text, which users can click to go right to your website.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Any chance Stack Exchange could add support for this, so new items in our SE inbox or new SE notifications could be pushed to Macs running Mavericks?</p>

I'm wondering if we can do the same for answers. </p>  <p>Currently we see the pop-in banner if a user has made a change to their answer. But several times now I've written up long, drawn-out comment to an answer, and in the meantime the user has realized their error and deleted their own answer. Currently I don't know that anything has changed until I hit the "add comment" button. Why isn't there a pop-up to notify me of the delete when it happens, just like the way it works for edits?</p> 	Show that an answer has been deleted<p>When viewing a question, there's a little header that shows up when an answer or the question itself has been edited, saying "an edit has been made to this post; click to load". However, there's no such header when an answer is deleted, which to me seems to be a more significant action than an edit. Could something like the edit notification show up when the post is deleted? Or even something more obvious, perhaps.</p>

Sometimes exceptional answers are hidden in low-interest questions that receive less traffic - so those will never be upvoted enough to become noticed.</p>  <p>Or maybe instead of a single blog for the entirety of SO, there should be an entire section called "Answer of the week" with more than one answer (maybe on a per-tag basis). Answers should arrive there based on manual nominations and not on upvotes so unpopular questions will not be discriminated against.</p>  <p><strong>Clarification:</strong></p>  <p>It's not that I'm personally against bounties - I use them plenty of times. I'm mostly concerned about what other people tend to do. I suspect the bounty post-answer reward is not used as much as it should.

non-duplicate	How are we intended to respond to moderator flags that ask a question?<p>Generally, moderator flags fall into one of the cookie-cutter categories given in the "flag" sheet. And even when community users choose to type a custom message into the "other" box, the flags require no communication back with the user. The action is simply taken (or not taken), and everyone goes about their business.</p>  <p>But what do we do in those (I imagine relatively rare cases) where a community member uses the free-form "other" box to ask a <em>specific question</em> about their post? For example, after having one of their posts deleted by a moderator, the user who originally posted the answer flags it and asks:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Why was this answer deleted?</p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>How are we supposed to deal with those flags?</strong> It seems like a perfectly valid question that is deserving of an answer, but there's no obvious way to communicate back with the user and provide them with such an answer. You could leave a comment on the deleted post explaining the rationale, and the person who posted it would still be able to read them even though the post has been deleted, but there's no way to add comments to a deleted post.</p>  <p>I suppose you could send the user an e-mail, but that seems like a pretty heavy-handed solution. Not everyone wants to receive correspondence for this site over e-mail, and e-mail seems best reserved for extended discussion, not simply answering the question of why a post was deleted.</p>  <p>Certainly I agree that we don't want to make such usages of moderator flags common-place. Perhaps it would be best to advise the user in question to take up the discussion on their site meta. But how do we advise the user of this without the ability to contact them?</p>  <p>I've seen <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/35431/provide-a-way-for-moderators-to-respond-to-the-person-who-flags-for-moderator-att">this feature request</a>, which attempts to provide a solution to the question that I'm asking. But I'm not necessarily in favor of adding a new feature. I'm merely seeking advice or input on what the expected practice is in the status quo.

non-duplicate	Would anyone care for some processed meat-like substance with a gelatinous glaze?<p>Something sort of magic happened a short time ago, sometimes a graph is worth a thousand flags:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wbJ8M.png" alt="This is awesome"></p>  <p>That's right, around March 28, the spam protection layer blocked about 20,000 spam attempts, mostly in  the form of suggested edits, while users didn't see much of an increase in what they had to flag in order to thwart it.</p>  <p>The false-positive rate remained the same, less than one percent - including a surprising amount of suggested edits that attempted to 'hijack' another user's question or answer with a completely different question. Yes, people are odd. </p>  <p>We capture the text that we block in our log table, which as you can imagine is getting quite obese with bacon and turkey flavored spam - I was wondering if any of you would find any value in me making a public dump of what we block available every 30 days or so? If yes, in what format would it be the most useful?</p>  <p>This is basically what you'd get in CSV format (or XML, JSON, SQLite DB):</p>  <pre><code>DateTime  WhyBlocked  BlockedText  SiteWhereItWasBlocked </code></pre>  <p>The <code>WhyBlocked</code> field will <strike>include text</strike> contain an integer that indicates if it was a suggested edit, post denied, post hobbled, etc. </p>  <p>Note, I'm currently working on a tool that will allow anyone interested to meta-moderate actions that the spam system takes. You just look at lots of crap while clicking 'spam' or 'not spam' - It's something I plan to hang off the network sort of unofficial-like for a while to determine just how useful of an endeavor it turns out to be. Tracking our false positive rate currently involves me running a query once each week, and counting the number of things that probably shouldn't have been blocked, of which there are exceedingly few. As you can tell, when we get .. this sort of volume, that quickly becomes an insurmountable task. Anyway, I digress.</p>  <p>What use would the data have, you ask?</p>  <ul> <li>You could conceivably come up with a list of the most prolifically spammed links</li> <li>Each spam bot has very specific purposes, from what I can see.

non-duplicate	Answer deleted because it came from MSDN?<p>On Stack&nbsp;Overflow, I'm a pretty frequent contributor with over 3K in reputation. Almost all of which earned by answering real user questions about Windows programming and other topics.</p>  <p>Last night, somone posted a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6759592/how-to-enable-int128-on-visual-studio">question</a>.  I knew the easiest thing to do would be to direct him to an appropriate documentation page on MSDN that I thought would help. And I literally did this:</p>  <ul> <li>Copied the URL directly into the post.</li> <li>Below the URL, copied two lines of content from that page that was relevant.</li> <li>Small code snippit below that.</li> </ul>  <p>Literally, this is what the answer looked like:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7e5yy2kb.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7e5yy2kb.aspx</a></p>      <p>This warning is automatically promoted to an error. If you wish to   modify this behavior, use #pragma warning. For example, to make C4235   into a level 2 warning, use the following line of code</p>  <pre><code>#pragma warning(2:4235) </code></pre> </blockquote>  <p>I felt that by cutting and pasting a quote from the website, and <strong>attributing it with the URL</strong> was proper form. Such that it's not ambiguous where the answer originated from - both from a copyright perspective as well as a courteous to the content owner.</p>  <p>About an hour later, I observed two things:</p>  <ul> <li><p>One moderator downvoting the answer and flagging it because "Copy/pasting. Nice. Did you see "© 2011 Microsoft. All rights reserved" at the bottom of that page"</p></li> <li><p>Another moderator deleted it with just a link to the FAQ - which says nothing about cut and paste or copyright rules.</p></li> </ul>  <p>Well that was disappoining. It wasn't like I was pasting a writeup without giving credit to the original author. Just a small quote from a well known reference site.</p>  <p>So here's my questions:</p>  <ol> <li><p>What is the policy around answers coming from other online reference sources?</p></li> <li><p>Is pasting a URL to a page with an answer OK?</p></li> <li><p>Is pasting content from the URL OK?  Even if it's attributed? Is there a proper way to attribute content when it originates from another site?</p></li> <li><p>Is there a proper way to attribute an answer if it originates elsewhere?</p></li> <li><p>Was I wrong to paste a snippet of content from MSDN, or was I wronged by aggressive moderators?</p></li> </ol>  <p>Now here's the real kicker - my day job is a software engineer at Microsoft. I am certain that my employer would not take issue at all with me helping the Windows development community by referencing pages they publish. So in some sense, the Stack&nbsp;Overflow communinity is just making it harder for the Windows experts to help the Windows community. It seems odd.</p> 	Is there even an automatic ban on meta?<p>Somewhere I heard the automatic question ban on Meta is set lower than on the main site. But looking at the profile of <a href="http://meta.softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/users/103/sam">this user on SR.SE</a> it looks like there is absolutely no automatic ban on meta.</p>  <p>Is this intended behaviour?</p> 
non-duplicate	Community moderators should have an access to private betas without commitment<p>Why? It is often quite handy to sneak in and see if the newborn site is not going into conflict with the one you moderate or to give external voice in certain meta threads.<br> Now it requires either fake commitment (which leads to stuck/unfilled commitments and thus slowing down new proposals) or using API and/or private beta users to bypass the system (so the current policy filters out almost <em>exclusively</em> harmless sneaks).</p>  <p>Why not not? It is not harmful since there is not too many of us and we are an aware users -- thus this won't alter the privateness of private beta.</p> 	Store the full OpenID URL, including scheme and domain name, differentiating HTTP from HTTPS<p>The association of an OpenID with the relying part must store the scheme used (OpenID spec 11.5.2):</p>  <blockquote>   <p>11.5.2. HTTP and HTTPS URL Identifiers</p>      <p>Relying Parties MUST differentiate between URL Identifiers that have different schemes.</p> </blockquote>  <p>However StackExchange strips the scheme from the URL and stores only the base domain name. Thus if I provide a URL of <code>https://www.mywebsite.com/...</code> StackExchange associates only <code>mywebsite.com/...</code>.  This is wrong on two counts, the lost scheme and the stripping of the subdomain (www).</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/F95o4.gif" alt="Logins shown by Stack Exchange"></p>  <p>Since StackExchange is then prepared to make the initial relying request using HTTP, the login is subject to having the response altered, allowing an attacker to substitute their own response, for example altering the response to delegate to a provider of their choosing:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;link rel="openid.server"   href="https://www.myopenid.com/server"&gt; &lt;link rel="openid.delegate" href="https://xxx.myopenid.com/"&gt; </code></pre>  <p>In addition, failure to clearly and visibly use HTTPS for the authentication form is a major fail on the part of the StackExchange network (see <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/128733/stackexchange-openid-provider-should-clearly-use-https">this question</a>).</p>  <p>And, of course, the authentication cookie is vulnerable to sniffing and session hijacking, a weakness that's been known for years.</p>  <p>To mitigate these problems I request that:</p>  <ol> <li>Stack&nbsp;Exchange stores the entire URL provided in the login form.</li> <li><strike>The login form be changed to permit the browser to store and autofill previous values for the manual OpenID field so that I don't have to type the entire URL every time I login.</strike> (done)</li> <li>That Stack&nbsp;Exchange run parallel HTTPS support for the entire network so that security aware users can avail themselves of it.</li> </ol>

However simply from the badge it is not possible to know if they are a bad users or a new user (you have to visit their page to know the number of questions they have asked)</p>  <p>I suggest the accepted answer bit of the tag should read 0/25 which clearly shows the lack of the individual. For good users this may get unwieldy (eg 345/350) so perhaps after a certain threshold the badge should revert to percentages.</p>  <p>EDIT: I had not noticed the mouse-over behaviour, perhaps some hint that exists for discoverability... or am I just SO fail?</p> 	Show decline reasons for declined flags on the Post Flag History page<p>Now that we have specific reasons for declining flags, it would be helpful to see them on the flag history page for questions and answers. </p>  <p>Right now, looking up the specific decline reason requires going to the flagger's profile and looking at their flag history to find the record of the flag there.</p> 
duplicate	Is there a way to search for those questions that have only negative votes?<p>I would like to search for questions with less than 0 votes (that is, only negative votes). There is a way to search for 0 or more, but not 0 or less?</p> 	Give us better search-by-score syntax<blockquote>   <h3>tl;dr: Give the score search operator ability to change between greater than and less than.</h3> </blockquote>  <p>I just noticed that searching for <code>score:0</code> turns up <em>only</em> question with a score equal to 0. Searching for <code>score:1</code> gives <em>everything</em> with a positive score. (>=1)</p>  <p>I can live with these. But here's the big one: <code>score:-1</code>.</p>  <p>I would expect it to give all the <em>negatively</em> scored posts - there <em>is</em> a minus sign in there.</p>  <p><strong>But it doesn't</strong>. It gives all the posts <em>></em>=-1. Greater than?</p>  <p>So, my <a href="/questions/tagged/feature-request" class="post-tag required-tag" title="show questions tagged 'feature-request'" rel="tag">feature-request</a> is that we get more granular search options for score.</p>  <p>For example,</p>  <ul> <li><code>score:1</code> would show all posts with <code>score == 1</code></li> <li><code>score:1+</code> would show everything <code>score &gt;= 1</code></li> <li><code>score:0</code> would show all posts with <code>score == 0</code></li> <li><code>score:-1</code> would show everything <code>score == -1</code></li> <li><code>score:-1-</code> would show al posts where <code>score &lt;= -1</code></li> </ul>  <p>In short, the operator <em>after</em> the number would show which direction to go with the matching. A minus sign means less than, a plus sign means greater than. No sign means exact.</p> 
duplicate	Inconsistent offensive/spam flag format on flagging summary page<p>First time I had to use the offensive flag. The answers were obviously offending/spam but it took quite a while to delete them. I was interested in how long it actually took, because an off-topic question posted later got closed much faster.</p>  <p>Instead of finding this information, I noticed the <em>offensive</em> (and also <em>spam</em>) flag's description is formatted very different. It also contains less information. </p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/alibH.png" alt="offensive flag"></p>  <ul> <li><em>"flagged as"</em> seems redundant - I know that I flagged it, and I'm on the flag summary page after all. The normal flagging doesn't tell me that.</li> <li><del>It is <em>Helpful</em>, but a normal flags are <em>helpful</em>.</del> (fixed)</li> <li>There is no information about the time I flagged it.</li> <li>The normal flag's <em>"helpful"</em> text contains a tooltip showing the time of it's acceptance, the offensive/spam flags don't.</li> </ul>  <p>I like that it's red, but I think the format should be more like that of the other flags. It should show the time somewhere.</p> 	Display of spam vs normal flags on flag summary inconsistent<p>As I was going through my flag summary on Stack Overflow, I noticed that we display different information depending on what kind of flag it is.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/l0SJs.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>These are the differences that I noticed:</p>  <ol> <li>"flagged as" prepended to the spam flag</li> <li>My username is included in the normal flag</li> <li>The time that I flagged with the normal flag is included in the display</li> </ol>

duplicate	Is it OK to replace links to cplusplus.com with links to cppreference.com on SO<p>I have been replacing links to cplusplus.com with links to cppreference.com for a while.

The favorite/ignored tab is redundant anyway, and the option "hide ignored tags" would fit nicely on the favorite/ignore tags section in the sidebar. At the current place, nobody finds the bloody checkbox anyway if they're not told exactly where to look, moving it to the actual favorite/ignore tag UI would make it vastly more discoverable and is a much more logical place for it.</p>

A late answer can also show up in the first posts section. If I review it in either of those two, it does not show up in the other one. If, however, I open each section in a separate tab, and the same answer shows up in both tabs, I can review it twice (no error whatsoever, it just works).</p>  <p>For example: <a href="http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/review/first-posts/17284">review #1</a> and <a href="http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/review/late-answers/17285">review #2</a>, both on  the same answer.</p>  <p>Is this a known issue?

duplicate	Bug in Approved Edit Suggestions Count?<p>When I look at my <code>Review Progress</code> on the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/">StackOverflow review page</a>, it tells me that I have edited <code>27</code> posts.</p>  <p>However, when I look at my <code>Editor Stats</code> on a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/suggested-edits/260814">suggested-edit page</a>, it tells me that I have had <code>29</code> edit suggestions approved.</p>  <p>I went through the list of <code>edit suggestions</code> I made, and it seems that I have <code>27</code> of them approved.  Why is there the discrepancy between the two?  Is this a bug or am I missing something?</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eHTey.png" alt="Review Progress"> <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QKJos.png" alt="Editor Stats"></p> 	Discrepancy between badge progress counter and editor stats<p>The counter for the Copy Editor badge progress is off by double digits in my profile. As you can see, I've had 100 edit suggestions accepted, but the progress counter shows 75:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cYZuq.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>Also, you can see yet a third count in my <strong>activity</strong> section:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ho7dG.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>I actually noticed the discrepancy a while back, but I was curious the badges would end up being based on the real count or the incorrect count in the progress stats, so I decided to wait until I reached 80 before posting on meta. When I reached 80, I realized that the badge progress counter is decremented when a post you've edited is removed, so I waited until I was over 80 not including removed posts. Then I waited until I was well above that threshold, just to be sure. </p>  <p>Based on the rep reversals in my profile, only 9 of the 100 posts I've edited have been removed. The 98 in the <strong>activity</strong> log makes sense, because I've seen that those entries go away when the post they refer to is deleted, so the number is the total number of edits (accepted and rejected) minus the number removed. There's one extra (100 approved + 6 rejected - 9 removed = 97, but the <strong>activity</strong> section's counter shows 98), but I'm sure there's a simple and logical explanation.</p>  <p>However, I can't explain why the badge progress counter only shows 75 when I have 91 accepted edits that haven't been removed. I'm not sure how rollbacks affect the count, but I find it unlikely that more than 16 of my edits have been rolled back. I'm not aware of any except one that I rolled back myself after realizing it was a mistake, even though it was approved.</p>  <p>Also, as of this writing I don't have the Strunk &amp; White badge, even though I passed 80 in the number of approved edits minus the number removed about a week ago. So, it appears that the badges are based on the same query that produces the flawed badge progress counter.</p>  <p><em>[I edited the title to make it clear to the tomato-throwers that this was intended as a "I noticed a discrepancy, why don't the numbers add up?" question,</em> <strong><em>not</em></strong> <em>a "Hey, no fair, where's my badge??" question.

Where are the others?</p>  <p>Side effect is that questions closed with a now gone reason have no reason at all. </p>  <p>Case in point: <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/67128/notepad-load-langs-xml-failed" title="you are language failure">a question previously closed as "no longer relevant"</a> doesn't display any reason at all (yes, it was <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/34815/give-diamond-moderators-the-ability-to-partially-lock-a-post" title="take a chill pill y'all">a bogus reason to stop</a> the many spam answers that should now be fixed):</p>  <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ACys1.png" alt="llama does a spit take"></p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Reverted this back to [bug] as the "<a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/posts/21612/revisions">empty close reason</a>" is still an issue that needs to be fixed.</p> 
duplicate	Usernames are displayed for questions on the main page, but no Action is displayed<p>On any given question the last person to add something to the question, be it ask, edit or answer it, is displayed(on the main page). </p>  <blockquote>   <p>1m ago TsSkTo 96</p> </blockquote>  <p>This, however, doesn't show what I did. So if someone comes along and edits it it would show their name and how long ago. Which can be confusing if one assumes the name assosiated with the question is the asker. </p>  <p>But even if the person with the last action on the question is displayed, shouldn't it be something like this?</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em>Asked by:</em> TsSkTo 96 1m ago</p> </blockquote>  <p>and then</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em>Edited by:</em> [moderator] 500k 25s ago</p> </blockquote>  <p>The Idea here being to add a field explaining what was the last <em>action</em> applied to the question along with who did it.</p>  <p>The Duplicate question shows the same problem, that being: </p>  <p><em>The last user to modify or add to the question is displayed on the list, along with the time stamp. It does not, however say what he or she did to the question, that is unless you click the time stamp and inspect the post.</em></p>  <p>In the previous question it was suggested that the original poster <em>always</em> be the one displayed on the question. That is flawed, I understand that the latest user to add to the question should be displayed in order to show when the question was last active. If one goes on to read the comments, the fact that there is no "Modified by" in the main list is mentioned and proposed as a good idea by the moderator answering the question. The last comment suggests the exact same thing.</p>  <p>The is the idea of this post is to provide and implement the solution that the "duplicate" post was unable to. The problem is still there. It <em>is</em> ambiguous what the person displayed has done to the question. Why not provide that information on the list? </p> 	Active Questions - Name should reflect original poster (and editor if exists)<p>I find it odd that in the list of Active Questions, the name of the person is the last one who replied/edited/commented on the question. However when you open the question, you see the real author + last editor:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5N9A6.png" alt="question detail"></p>  <p>However, the very same question in the “list” looks like this:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dVryT.png" alt="alt text"></p>  <p>This is awful, because it gives the reader the impresion that I wrote that question, which in this case belongs to Mr. Sam Day. </p>  <p>As someone who has editing permission on the site, I am constantly fixing small typos and formatting errors, but this makes my name appear in the front page all the time. (note: the site is apple.se, but I’m sure this is the same for others).</p>  <p><strong>update</strong>: Let me put it in another way. I go to apple.se.com and I see this:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mXZns.png" alt="ListOfQuestions"></p>  <p>In both cases it looks like I asked the questions mainly because the second one doesn’t have any answer yet has a “name”. </p>  <p>In my opinion, it’s not clear and it should say or show both names.</p>

non-duplicate	Highlighting the Tag Wikis<p>There have been some discussions (<a href="http://meta.reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/143/189">1</a>, <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/9242518#9242518">2</a>) on the usefulness and visibility of Tag Wikis. Two concerns that have repeatedly been voiced are :</p>  <ul> <li>Searchability</li> <li>Visibility</li> </ul>  <p>These are major problems with the wikis and here are some ideas on how to improve this. </p>  <h2>Firstly, why at all?</h2>  <p>Tag Wikis are an <a href="http://meta.reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/60/189">awesome resource</a>. Stack sites' have a lot of expertise and wikis are one way of documenting and showing it to new users. Tag Wikis can contain some of the canonical information as well as stuff that would not normally be a good fit for the Q&amp;A format, even though the expertise is there, and so is the willingness to help.</p>  <h2>Possible Solutions</h2>  <h3>Searchability</h3>  <p>Making Tag Wikis searchable should not / would not be a very difficult task. They are indexed by Google, so they are searchable externally. </p>  <p>I think they should be made searchable similar to questions and answers internally as well. In a search query, the tags should first be identified, and then the remaining terms could be searched for within the wiki. Then, questions and answers could be searched normally. If the Tag Wikis are well written and curated, they would have the FAQs of the tag and some of the commonly asked information as well, making the search process possibly faster and return relevant results.</p>  <h3>Visibility</h3>  <p>Tag Wikis are a minimum 3 clicks away* from the home page whereas questions and answers are 1 click away. This itself is a demotivating factor as far as putting efforts into the wikis are concerned as compared to asking and answering. Moreover, the chances of a new user even stumbling onto the wikis is remote. </p>  <p>To tackle this, Tag Wikis could be brought right onto the home page. Clicking on a tag from the panel on the home page would redirect to the wiki and not to the tagged questions. This would be only from the top panel.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WJIGB.png" alt="[RE](http://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/)"></p>  <p>The tags that appear on the top panel would be ones that are selected via a democratic process by the community, and not simply the most popular ones. This would allow for the site's best wikis to be displayed on the home page. </p>  <h3>Too much space?</h3>  <p>This would occupy a lot of real estate and the reason why I think some text should be kept (contrary to the current implementation) is so that new users see it, and then may get curious enough to click through. If we simply had tags, it would not highlight the wiki as prominently, thereby reducing the chances of even getting mouse-overs. It could however, be made dismissable, or not appear for users having rep>some limit as they most likely would know about the wikis.</p>  <h2>Where?</h2>  <p>Depending on the implementation, most of the high volume established sites would not want this IMO, so this request is targeted towards the newer SE sites, especially beta sites. Beta sites have a much lower volume of questions but not any lack of expertise. Hence, putting efforts into resources such as the wiki is viable for newer sites. It can become an excellent way of showing and documenting the community expertise for new users. </p>  <p><sub> *Wikis are reachable by hovering and clicking on info. However, considering there are 6 clickable options on the hover-card plus hovering by itself is not something new users would do, this is rather un-intuitive. </sub>  </p>  <hr>  <h3><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/188197/200868">Part 2</a> is now up!</h3> 	cookies remembering openID authentication for stackoverflow, but not serverfault or superuser?<p>Does anyone else have this problem?</p>  <p>I'm logged into stackoverflow, superuser, and serverfault using my openID account. If I close a tab, and visit the same site again, it maintains my logged-in state. When I restart my browser, however, I have to log into superuser and serverfault again, but stackoverflow remembers me. Is there a bug?</p> 
non-duplicate	Make editing a more powerful feature<p>I just realized that I can approve or reject post edits with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits">this nifty tool</a> (5k+ only). Using it, I've seen which types of edits are generally approved:</p>  <ul> <li>Fixing English (e.g. spelling, punctuation, grammar, making things more idiomatic)</li> <li>Removing happy talk (e.g. salutations, greetings, pointless meandering)</li> <li>Tidying up formatting (e.g. adding code blocks, breaking up text into paragraphs)</li> <li>Fixing dead links and images</li> <li>Fixing tags</li> </ul>  <p>I think all of this is awesome. It's really great that posts by non-native speakers who put reams of text in one paragraph with broken links next to some unformatted code with five tags that aren't really relevant to the question are quickly tidied up by the community.</p>  <p>That said, there is a certain category of edits that could potentially be helpful but are <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/64841/editing-someone-elses-wrong-answer-to-make-it-right">generally</a> <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/106687/editing-a-partial-answer-to-be-more-complete">rejeccted</a> because they are too hard to moderate:</p>  <ul> <li>Correcting factually erroneous or incomplete information</li> <li>Adding helpful information or code examples</li> <li>Fixing bad practices in the code</li> <li>...anything that changes the meaning of the post</li> </ul>  <p>I can easily see the problems that could arise by allowing these types of edits. Even so, I think that most of the time, these edits are actually constructive, and having a mechanism to accomodate them would increase the quality of posts.</p>  <p>Currently, comments sort of fill this role. When there is something wrong with a post people will usually comment to say so. I'm usually grateful when people point this sort of thing out and will fix it most of the time.</p>  <p>What if people could suggest these sorts of edits and the poster could approve of them? That way, posts could be improved more directly.</p>  <p>Personally, I think it would be really neat if people were encouraged to enhance the actual content of my posts. They would get satisfaction from fixing the internet, and I would be happy to have other people make me look good. It would make editing more powerful and I think it would do a lot to encourage even more community effort.</p>  <p>Does this sound like a good idea?</p> 	Reputation purely from questions<blockquote>   <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>   <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/33398/the-surest-way-to-gain-lots-of-reputation-on-stack-overflow-ask-questions">The surest way to gain lots of reputation on Stack Overflow- ask questions</a><br>   <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/117338/can-there-be-a-badge-encouraging-answering-a-certain-ratio-of-questions">Can there be a badge encouraging answering a certain ratio of questions?</a>  </p> </blockquote>    <p>As I understand it, we have the reputation system on SO mainly for two reasons</p>  <ul> <li>Reward helpful users</li> <li>Indicate a user's experience level</li> </ul>  <p>The second item tends to work pretty well most of the time. However, I have noticed occasional extreme disparities between a user's reputation level and experience. This usually occurs in questions but can also occur in answers. </p>  <p>When I notice this, I usually look at the user's page. In every case (in my limited experience) the user has ~10:1 question:answer ratio. In extreme cases I've seen 300-400 (or even 1000) questions with zero answers. </p>  <p>Example: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/39677/blankman">This user</a> has asked ~ 1800 questions and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/11552465/1487063">this is their most recent one</a></p>  <p>The main reason I ask is because I hate wading through horrible questions when I could be answering good ones and I have to at least READ the question before I can determine its quality. It's true that it's just more work - but SO isn't a job. The less work I have to do to find good questions (that deserve an answer) the more questions get answered. And the less cluttered and easier to use the site is.</p>  <p>What would be a good solution?</p> 
non-duplicate	Should we instruct how to create and review tag wikis better?<p>I've just ran across these two edit suggestions:</p>  <ul> <li><p>A <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/5084642">wiki excerpt suggestion</a> which is a complete copypasta with apparently no attribution, and of course, not condensed enough to be helpful as an excerpt. This one was approved.</p></li> <li><p>a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/5084644">wiki suggestion</a> which is, put simply, completely useless to the site and the community. Even then, two users voted to approve this.</p></li> </ul>  <p>Is there any way to better instruct tag editors and reviewers, as well as aiding them in the process?</p>  <hr>  <p>As far as I can see, the editor possibly thought it was okay to throw in the copypasta into the excerpt and attribute it in the wiki body. I'm not sure if that is okay, but I'm sure copypastas are hardly ever suitable for a wiki excerpt. Should also note that as the wiki body has been rejected, there is no attribution whatsoever right now.</p>  <h2>Improve the tag wiki editing experience</h2>  <p>Right now, the tag wiki editing page displays <a href="http://i.imgur.com/uxvsEps.png" rel="nofollow">this side text</a>, but it doesn't feel very attractive, it also does not look as important as it actually is, being pushed aside from the page like that. The editor, in this case, completely ignored the side text.</p>  <p>Another issue is that the side text does not mention proper attribution, which is a quite frequent rejection reason. In fact, detecting plagiarism is an arduous task, wouldn't it be possible for the SE engine to detect and reject when a tag wiki edit consists of 100% copypasta without attribution, giving the editor a helpful message?</p>  <p>Still on the side text topic, the side text contains a link to <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/redesigned-tags-page/">this blog post</a> as a reference for writing good tag wikis. It is a good reference, indeed. However, a blog post seems way too long-winded for editors that simply want to write a tag wiki. A Help Center page would be more objective, easier to find and useful, in my opinion.</p>  <p>It might also be worth nothing that the current minimum length for a tag wiki body is 30 characters, I believe this could be bumped up a little.</p>  <h2>Improve the tag wiki reviewing experience</h2>  <p>Currently, reviewers are simply given the privilege to review tag wiki and excerpt edits after attaining 5,000 reputation, in contrast to the 20,000 reputation required to edit a tag wiki without going through peer review. I'm not sure whether raising the required reputation would be helpful, but it is one thing to consider.</p>  <p>In my opinion, the main issue with reviewers is that they are capable of reviewing tag wikis without ever having edited one themselves, that is, without even going through the (relatively poor) side text in the tag wiki editing screen.</p>  <p>I believe adding a "Help" button in the tag wiki review screen would be tremendously useful for new tag wiki reviewers. The Help button could display a popup/sidebar with the aforementioned tag wiki's side text tips, or simply link to a Help Center page version of the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/redesigned-tags-page/">redesigned tags page blog post</a>.</p>  <hr>  <p>These are just some ideas and my personal views, feel free to comment and answer with your own Tag Wiki creating/editing/reviewing improvement suggestions and opinions.</p>  <p>I don't expect all of these suggestions to be implemented, rather I'd like to discuss their viability and get more suggestions from the community before making a proper feature request.</p> 	border question closed<blockquote>   <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>   <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/145350/why-are-there-some-type-of-questions-that-are-open-and-highly-upvoted-while-oth">Why are there some type of questions that are open and highly upvoted, while others of that same type are closed?

I'm sure that he did not intend to keep this around for a while himself(may have missed this one) because it was never meant to be a question.

Your reset basically says:</p>  <ul> <li>We users are not to be allowed to go out and play without adult supervision</li> <li>We are too stupid to figure out how to make good use of the site</li> <li>We users should do all the work in making the metrics easy to understand</li> <li>The SE/SO platform doesn't really do what it claims (make good content bubble up)</li> </ul>  <p>I may have more later.</p>  <p>I actually decided to give this new set of rules a try - but I can't get over the fact that votes and questions are a scarce resource so I am not going to bother.

duplicate	"Improve" treated as improper response to proper response to audit<p>For the first time I failed an audit in review, but I sure don't think I should have.</p>  <p>I saw the edit wasn't that good, so I hit the improve button to clean things up and got this message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>This was an audit, designed to see if you were paying attention. You didn't pass. This edit vandalizes the post. Don't improve it – Reject it</p> </blockquote>  <p>Sure, I could have rejected it, but some of those can just be improved, especially if the original post needed editing.</p>  <p>Maybe <em>SO could keep track of my successful improves and see that I know what I'm doing, and let me hit the improve button and not fail me for the audit</em>.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>  <p>I realized after it happened to me again today, that my workflow is to see that there is an error, and instead of checking the whole post, I go into edit mode, and then completely go over the post editing it as needed.  Since SO doesn't seem to want to adapt to that kind of workflow, I'll unfortunately have to change mine, or just do less.  It really slows things down to have to completely go over a post twice (kind of like the inbox zero concept, try to deal with things immediately).</p> 	User Training tool for editing<p>While reviewing a post another one appeared when I was finished. This second post was difficult to comprehend so much I didn't know who was posting and who was attempting an edit. Of course it is marked, but again both were such a mess (I suspected maybe ESL?) that I decided to attempt an edit so I could see what the result was going to be.</p>  <p>I was given a notice that this was some sort of system test that indicated I was in error in editing what was an attempt to deface a post. It pointed out my failure, but I intended on cancelling this edit, but wasn't given the chance.</p>  <p>Maybe this could be adjusted so it waits until the laast step before assuming someone is making an error?

I came very close to 50 reputation points and then people went through and voted down my discussions with the OP.</p>  <p>This is almost akin to the "you can't get a job without experience" conundrum, and I feel an easy solution would be to lower the amount of reputation points required to comment on posts. It's ridiculous that this community is so hostile to someone who is only trying to contribute instead of just taking without giving back.</p>  <p>EDIT: Thanks, to whomever went through and voted up enough things to get me to 50 reputation points! </p> 	Not enough Reputation - wanting to answer/comment<p>Ive seen a few questions Id like to comment on or give a different answer, but seeing how I dont have 50 reputation (I've been a lurker for years, finaly decided to participate) do I really need to ask a few questions before I can comment/answer other people's stuff?

That indents by four spaces to produce something like this:</p>  <pre><code>alert("hello"); </code></pre>  <p>Thats all fine and dandy but if you want to include code in a list, that is where the "format as code" button fails, because it always simply adds (or removes) 4 spaces before the highlighted block.

The system would just sit there, with the log-in prompt still shown in the site header (no name shown, so you appear as log-off) but any new attempt to log won't display the login&amp;password fields anymore - they reappear only if I clear all browser cookies.</p>  <p>Any idea why this is happening? Based on the mail date, I believe that the invitation may have timed-out, but it wouldn't work even last saturday (although that may depend on some network problem on my side during the weekend)... Any hope to have the invitation renewed so that I may try again to create that account?</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Seems to be similar to the problem described in this post: <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/154730/cannot-accept-invitation-to-stack-overflow-careers-2-0">Cannot accept invitation to Stack Overflow Careers 2.0</a></p>  <hr>  <p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>: About the login problems</p>  <p>I followed Jason advice and cleared the cookies, then tried to log on the careers site, but the problem didn't go away.  That said, I noticed something strange: the first login prompt after clearing the cookies displayed the "log with open id" panel on the right, but any following attempt displayed it on the LEFT. After that, clicking the "login with stack exchange" option would just log me for that single postback - any other link I follow will then redisplay the standart logged out interface. Also, I went to log on meta soon after and as usual I wasn't prompted to retype the credential (just like when you first log on a site in the stackexchange family and you are already logged on another site), so the cookie must be there </p> 	Double clicking close link kills the popup<p>Due to the perils of a slow internet connection, I often find myself accidentally clicking the close button in the review queue multiple times.  </p>  <p>Irritatingly, this closes the pop-up that fired with the first click.  The "unable to load popup, please try again" box displays behind the pop-up briefly before it closes then it takes multiple further clicks to reopen the close dialogue. </p>  <p>This also occurs for the close links in the normal question view, however <strong>not</strong> for the flag dialogues.  If these are double clicked then the unable to load popup appears <em>behind</em> the flag dialogue but the flag popup remains in place - as you would expect! </p>  <p>I had thought that this was just an irritating design fact, but as it's inconsistent between similar processes (the bounty popup also remains in place if clicked multiple times) I'll post it as a minor bug.  </p> 
non-duplicate	Add optional cross-site "already asked" link to off-topic close reason<p>This topic was already discussed in <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/151729/225745">Allow cross-site duplicate closing</a> feature request. It was badly received and I generally agree, but it has some valid points.</p>  <p>So far conclusions that was not disproved are, in favor of off-topic:</p>  <ul> <li>If question is off-topic on the site, it should be closed as such.</li> <li>If questiin is on-topic on more than one site, each site will provide answers to different aspects of a problem.</li> </ul>  <p>On the other side, in favor of duplicates:</p>  <ul> <li>Closing as duplicate would help redirect future users to where question belongs and is answered.</li> <li>Deleting off-topic questions means they are not searchable, and users post again.</li> <li><p>Closing with off-topic message </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Questions on programming, PHP, SQL, etc. that do not relate directly to Drupal are off-topic here, but can be asked on Stack Overflow.</p> </blockquote>  <p>results with question posted again on Stack Overflow and closed there, this time as a duplicate, increasing user's frustration.</p></li> </ul>  <p><strong>The way to solve this and satisfy both sides would be:</strong></p>  <p>For close reasons saying to ask on another page (and custom ones), provide optional field for cross-site duplicate link. Of course Stack sites only. Change message text to something like:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Questions on programming, PHP, SQL, etc. that do not relate directly to Drupal are off-topic here, and this one was already asked on Stack Overflow [link].</p> </blockquote>  <p>It should work as regular off-topic with following changes:</p>  <ul> <li>should be exempted from automatic deletion,</li> <li>should provide the same redirection (if any) as duplicates.</li> </ul>  <p>That way questions about HTML, CSS, PHP and so on will not appear and disappear on CMS related sites, as people interested in programming or styling something in that particular CMS will see a result in their search and will be directly send to the proper page. What more, person who posted off-topic like that would be sent directly to answers, so he will have to deal wit only one closure and will see his answers sooner.</p>  <p>This would also be an easier and cleaner way to handle the situation where new users, upon learning a different site is better for their question, cross-posts before the question can be migrated.</p>  <p><strong>Important note:</strong> I'm not talking about user or user group reposting off-topic questions once they have been told it's off-topic. I want to help honest users that are <em>asking in good faith</em>, posting on Drupal Answers or WordPress Answers what should be posted on Stack Overflow because <em>they have put their problem in search</em> and didn't found any results. Usually question about the same thing was asked by another user, but it's now long gone deleted, thus invisible in search.

It says I'm at 202 (which would be eligible for the badge), but when I hover over it, I see the following information:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Mp9N.jpg" alt="Hover text"></p>  <p>Unless math has changed recently, 31 and 158 do not add up to 202. So where did this number even come from? The only thing I can think of is that deleted posts are being included in that count, but why? Why would my questions even be included in that count?</p>  <p>Considering that the tag score at the left only includes your score from answers, why does the count at the right not also only include answers? Consistency here is out of whack. I like being able to hover over it to see the full details, but the number there should be 158, because <strong>my score of 1k is <em>from</em> those 158 answers</strong>, not from the questions or the deleted posts (I presume).</p>  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This is <em>not</em> a caching issue since I have had no reputation changes on my account since the tag score recalculations at 03:00 UTC, at the time of taking that screenshot.</p>

duplicate	Why is no moderation required before banning a user from asking questions? Poor question ban system<p>It's striking to me that people can be banned from asking questions so seemingly trivially by an apparently dumb algorithm with no review, yet other, less important moderation functions need several <em>actual humans</em> to agree to the action.</p>  <p>I know that the Stack Exchanges are originally a programmers' site, and programmers think programming solutions are great, but I'd like to put forward that certain permanent moderation actions (such as banning users from participating) should be done by <em>actual humans</em>, especially since the post-ban algorithm is broken (as explained below).</p>  <p>A much more sensible solution is use some sort of pre-question ban queue.</p>  <ol> <li>A user passes a threshold which bans them from posting for a week or what have you.  They are put into a moderation queue.</li> <li>Other users have a week to vote / agree to make the ban permanent.    </li> <li>After a week is past, the user is banned or not.</li> </ol>  <p>As for why I think the question ban algorithm sucks, it has blocked me from asking questions on SuperUser after only two questions--one with no votes, another question with a single downvote, and my answer to my own question with a single downvote on it (after noone answered it).  By any reasonable tally, I think that a user being banned after 3 posts with two single downvotes on them is outrageous.</p> 	What can I do when getting "We are no longer accepting questions/answers from this account"?<p>Do not repost the question you were about to ask until you have </p>  <h2><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/86998/102937">READ EVERYTHING WE ARE ABOUT TO TELL YOU</a>.</h2>  <p>While trying to ask a question, one could get:</p>    <blockquote>   <p>We are no longer accepting questions from this account.

It has a great answer which deserves being preserved (which locking achieves) <em>and curated</em> (which locking prevents).</p>  <p>The only close reason I can see that could apply to this question is <em>too broad</em>. But unlike other close reasons, the proof of <em>too broad</em> is in the answering. Jonathan Leffler has managed to write a great answer, and that proves that the question was answerable.</p>  <p>The question should be refocused a little on the points that the answer addresses, to wit, the use of <code>extern</code> to share variables across source files.

duplicate	After nominating to re-open, link remains as if you can nominate again<p>First of all I know this is a super small bug, but it's still a bug (in my opinion, anyway). When you nominate to re-open a closed question, the link to re-open stays there and if you click it a second time, the same dialog appears as if it is going to let to do it again (but of course doesn't let you).</p>  <p>Normally, I would ignore small things like this. However, I think this kinda makes StackExchange sites appear a little funky. In a way, it (sorta) makes it look bad. I myself have to laugh at this, and I'm sure others have also laughed at it.</p>  <p>The point is, it shouldn't even allow you to press this link again in the first place. Or at least don't show the same dialog asking if you're sure you want to nominate to re-open. Just immediately alert the user that they already nominated.</p>  <p>That is all.</p> 	Bug in nominating question for reopening<ol> <li>A question was closed</li> <li>As user, I decide to vote for reopening.</li> <li>I click on the <strong><em>Reopen</em></strong> link.</li> <li><p>An confirm alert appears.</p>  <pre><code>Nominate this question for reopening?                        &lt;Cancel&gt; &lt;OK&gt; </code></pre></li> <li>I click <strong>OK</strong> button.

non-duplicate	2012 Election: Four(?) New Moderators<p>The <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/election">2012 Election</a> ended a few hours ago and the three available position were fill via the democratic process. Congratulations to the three new moderators: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/19679">Brad Larson</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/16587">George Stocker</a>, and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/298479">ThiefMaster</a>! ...except there are <strong>four</strong> new moderators.  This fourth moderator seems to have been "called up after the election to meet additional demand".  But the election only finished a couple hours ago, what influx of demand has occurred in the last few hours?  </p>  <p>Though <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2598">jjnguy</a> appears qualified, this appointment appears underhand. If there was a clear need for four moderators, why did the community not have the chance to elect four moderators?</p> 	Title for bounty FAQ item<p>The title "What if I don't get an answer?" does not bring "bounty" to mind. I saw bounties from using Stack Overflow and was interested to learn more. I tried looking in the FAQ but didn't find anything and eventually did a google search which is how I found out that "What if I don't get an answer?" is the question for bounties. Perhaps putting "(bounty)" or "(bounties)" after the question would help the title be more descriptive.</p> 
non-duplicate	Answers that work and are mostly right vs later always right answers<p>Sometimes the optimization for the right answer picks up only the working answer rather than the more correct answer. And there is a distinction. Here's my example:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/190396/adding-html-entities-using-css-content/1412764#1412764">Adding HTML entities using CSS content</a></p>  <p>At first (years ago) a ~10 vs 1 vote difference is attributed to my total lateness in replying (even in ever running into this issue). So I understand why the asker had picked that answer. But it's been on the site for a couple of years, and the answer that works for the question but doesn't always work for the general titled issue keeps getting votes as being both right and the best answer; maybe because it was chosen as the answer and works. I know my answer that points out where this working answer could go wrong is appreciated by some, since it's gotten some votes slowly, but mostly it's never going to catch up given the current ~70 vs 5 vote difference.</p>  <p>Do you think this is a problem for keeping answers current and correct on the site?</p>  <p>Note, before picking this as an example for my question I edited my answer a little to not start out referencing the other answer. You can look at the edits and muse over whether the wording led to this rather than the timing and the it-works nature.</p> 	technology tag [postgres] instead of [postgresql] in Careers<p>In SO the tag for PostgreSQL is correct <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/postgresql" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'postgresql'" rel="tag">postgresql</a>, but on Careers technology tag <code>postgresql</code> doesn't exist (or at least not in auto-complete dropdown), but rather one with pre-2004 name of that database: <code>postgres</code>. I believe these tags should be in sync.</p>  <p>EDIT: I'm referring to technologies, which you can put in your profile. </p> 
non-duplicate	could adding too much information be counter productive to getting an answer?<p>When you ask a question on one of the SE sites, adding a lot of (useful) information, could it be true that more people go tl;dr on it, and just move on to a simpler and shorter question? And is there a way to encourage answering longer questions, where the asker added more useful info?</p> 	Request: reduce Tag Badge requirements for a rare tag<p>As it stands, it is hard to get a tag badge for a tag that has a small community on StackOverflow.</p>  <p>Consider the tag <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/mathematica/topusers">mathematica</a>.  This is not a minor tag, but a tag for all Mathematica users' questions, but as there are comparatively few Mathematica users on StackOverflow, even great answers receive a limited number of votes.</p>  <p>The top users in the community are:</p>  <pre><code>votes | answers _________________________  320  |  127     belisarius  267  |  65      Michael Pilat  254  |  66      Leonid Shifrin </code></pre>  <p>I am requesting that the vote requirements for this tag be reduced somewhat, that the badges may realistically be within reach, and that the top users may be recognized.</p>

non-duplicate	Where should questions about MathJaX go?<p>I'm asking this from the perspective of the TeX-SX site.  Basically, we don't want them unless they are really questions about TeX and not about MathJaX.  In particular, questions about configuring MathJaX, about installing MathJaX, and about how to do something particular in MathJaX, are all off-topic on TeX-SX.  The reason being that MathJaX does not use TeX and so expertise in TeX does not help at all in answering questions such as those above.  Although we have a MathJaX tag, the phrasing hopefully makes this clear: <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/tags/mathjax/info">http://tex.stackexchange.com/tags/mathjax/info</a></p>  <p>To be <em>absolutely</em> clear, it isn't that we have anything against MathJaX.  It is because the expertise that exists on TeX-SX has no relevance whatsoever for helping people with MathJaX and therefore it is in the questioner's best interests to find a better place to ask their question.</p>  <p>But we occasionally get questions about it, and also get questions migrated from other sites about it.  Where should we redirect those questions on this network, if anywhere?  Our tag, linked above, suggests the main StackOverflow site, but the most recent migration (and the reason why I'm asking this) came from there.  And was migrated after it had been answered by the lead developer of MathJaX!</p>  <p>StackOverflow version: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12581495/mathjax-and-latex-definecolor?noredirect=1">MathJax and LaTeX \definecolor</a></p> 	Can a Reddit-like SOPA-blackout be of benefit to SO and/or its users?<blockquote>   <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>   <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/118612/any-chance-of-stackexchange-blacking-out-jan-18-along-with-reddit-in-oppositio">Any chance of StackExchange blacking out Jan 18, along with Reddit, in opposition of SOPA/PIPA?</a>  </p> </blockquote>    <p>Reddit will go down in protest to SOPA, a law that could, in theory, bring down SOFU, Reddit, and whatnot (probably some sites you like will go down, but I think not sites like Facebook or Twitter, solely for their popularity).</p>  <p>You probably know about all of that already.</p>  <p>This question is not "please bring down SO". Of course I love SO and I'd be a little annoyed if it goes down for a few hours or a day. Some people (IMO everyone against the idea of such a protest) wouldn't get any work done while SO is down.</p>  <p>Now, that makes me think it's a wonderful opportunity to make the people that depend on SO to get work done to:</p>  <ul> <li>Realize that they're being lazy some/most of the time (<em>some</em> users are like that)  </li> <li>Being forced to think for themselves for these few hours, potentially making them better users</li> <li>See what SOPA would be like</li> </ul>  <p>and for SO it's an opportunity to:</p>  <ul> <li>Make its users see the value the site has for them</li> <li>Since it will probably be tweeted g+ed and facebooked, it will draw attention to both SO and to SOPA (even for non-SO users!)</li> <li>Show how much the site cares about doing something significant (I'd see SO in a completely different light after such a thing)</li> <li>Save some bandwidth ;)</li> </ul>  <p>...All of that in the account of SOPA, but it could be good for more than just warning its user base about the to-be Great Firewall of America.</p>  <p>And I know <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/114020/please-do-not-use-stack-overflow-to-promote-social-causes">some people don't care</a>. Some also won't care about global warming until there's any effect on their lives, others didn't care about hitler assuming power until he did, etc. There's a lot of short-sighted people, and those are the ones that will benefit the most from seeing <em>SOPA does apply to them too and it's real</em></p>  <p>So, before this question gets closed as not constructive: it's about wether SOPA is presenting an opportunity (an excuse) to blackout the site <em>for it's own profit</em> (and of its users).</p> 
duplicate	System says I flagged as "not welcome", but I didn't<p>I flagged a question as spam, and wanted to add a second, custom flag to let moderators and developers know about a repeating pattern I was seeing. When I clicked the flag link to add the second flag, I got this dialog:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wn5sN.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>It says that I already raised both a <em>spam</em> flag and a <em>not welcome</em> flag, but that's not true; I just raised one flag, a <em>spam</em> flag. It probably does make sense to disable both options when either type of flag was already raised, but the messages stating that I raised two flags are wrong and confusing.</p> 	"You have already raised this flag" Well, not really<p>After I <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/188815/whos-supposed-to-stop-spam-on-the-bitcoin-se-site">joined the mob</a> and flagged some spam on the <a href="http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/">Bitcoin Beta</a>, for a poorly-understood reason, I went back to one of the questions I'd flagged and opened the flag dialog.

non-duplicate	So many questions so few answers<p>When I first started using SO about 2 years ago, there were lots of questions, and lots of answers. Great answers even. It was wonderful because you were almost guaranteed to get some kind of answer. </p>  <p>Now it seems like getting even 1 answer is increasingly difficult. I find that many questions are by people who have question to answer ratio's of 10:1 or more (mine is 1:15).</p>  <p>Would it be possible to send a gentle reminder to people when their ratio goes above say 5? I don't think it would be productive to force them to answer more questions (who wants bad answers), but some kind of encouragement to share their knowledge.</p>  <p>Am I alone it seeing this disappointing trend?</p> 	Code block can't handle DOCTYPE lines correctly<blockquote>   <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>   <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3327/code-block-is-not-properly-formatted-when-placed-immediately-after-a-list-item">Code block is not properly formatted when placed immediately after a list item</a><br>   <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3792/how-to-nest-code-within-a-list-using-markdown">How to nest code within a list using markdown</a>  </p> </blockquote>    <p>Lines like </p>  <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML+RDFa 1.0//EN"` "http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/DTD/xhtml-rdfa-1.dtd"&gt;` </code></pre>  <p>Won't be displayed in the editor if they come after a bullet list item, only with the `inline code` syntax.

duplicate	Yes, I'm really sure I want to delete that post<p>Attempting to delete questions on the mobile site on iOS causes two notification messages asking me to confirm the deletion, which it shouldn't do.</p>  <p><del>I haven't really looked into it, but it may just be that</del> the handlers from full.js and mobile.js are both being triggered, as there seems to be the flash of the error dialog indicating something went wrong on the supposed second AJAX request when the response from the first triggers a page reload.</p>  <p>You can see this happening by following the method calls; the mobile view first calls </p>  <pre><code>StackExchange.question.init() -&gt; StackExchange.question.fullInit()   -&gt; StackExchange.vote.init()     -&gt; u()  </code></pre>  <p>...where <code>u()</code> sets a delegated click handler on</p>  <pre><code>$("div.post-menu *[id^='delete-post-'], table.flagged-posts *[id^='delete-post-']") </code></pre>  <p>...that calls <code>.preventDefault()</code> on the event, but doesn't block other handlers from firing.</p>  <p>It then later calls <code>StackExchange.mobile.init()</code>, which in turn calls the method <code>J()</code> that sets up a similar handler directly on <code>$(".delete-post")</code>.</p>  <p>Since both handlers get triggered, there's two confirmation dialogs, and two attempts to delete the post. The extra handler in mobile.js seems unnecessary, so just removing it would appear to be the easy fix to the problem.</p> 	Delete on mobile gives double prompts<p>When a <strike>moderator</strike> user clicks to delete a post on the mobile site, we are presented with two Javascript confirmation prompts; one asking "vote to delete this post?", and another asking "delete this post".

non-duplicate	Difference between Stack Overflow and a wiki<p>After I recommended stack overflow to a friend she briefly looked at it and concluded it was not much different than a wiki.

For example:</p>  <ul> <li>The attribution system that is both quantitative and democratic</li> <li>meta sites allow the site rules to be democratically defined as well</li> <li>etc...</li> </ul> 	How can I see the number of times I earned a badge?<p>Title says it all.

If they are, in which order they are shown?</p> 	Why does Stack Overflow not honor the order of tags?<p>I just posted <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18109475/make-capybara-use-multiple-tabs-not-windows">a question related to Capybara</a>, and after tagging it as such added the 'ruby' tag as well, since (of course) Capybara is used from and written in Ruby.</p>  <p>Although 'capybara' was the first tag, Stack Overflow chose 'ruby' as the primary tag to display in the title.  Why is this?  What are the effects of this?  Is there any way to change this other than just removing the 'ruby' tag?</p>  <p>Because Ruby is a much more general category than Capybara, it seems to me that making 'capybara' the primary tag makes more sense and will be more likely to make it stand out to the right people.  Is this correct?  But on the other hand, a good portion of Rubyists know something about Capybara, so I'd like to keep the 'ruby' tag there too, so they notice it too.</p>

non-duplicate	Replace accept rate with citizenship level<p>I see that accept rate has now been <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/164654">removed from display on questions</a>. I think this is not a great solution for <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/104371">reasons that waffles explained well</a>. Take it away waffles!</p>  <hr>  <p>On one hand accept rate bothers me a lot, it is a one-dimensional metric that does not really give me enough information about how upstanding a user is in the community. It is used frequently to bully users and leaves a horrible taste. </p>  <p>On the other hand, introducing accept rates <strong>heavily increased the amount of accepted answers</strong> in the system. Which in turn helps close loops and motivate the community.</p>  <p>That said, I do not think it would be beneficial to simply retire accept rate if there is no replacement offered.</p>  <p>When we introduced the accept rate stuff we were careful not to add too much of a value statement. On hover we do not say "horrible user, never accepts answers". </p>  <p>Going forward <strong>I would much prefer that we retired accept rate in favor of a more general metric that covers a variety of "citizenship" metrics that do not result in rep.</strong></p>  <ul> <li>Does the user vote? </li> <li>Does the user accept answers? </li> <li>Does the user answer questions? </li> <li>Does the user edit or suggest edits on questions? </li> <li>Does the user flag stuff? </li> </ul>  <p>I don't know, perhaps we should go the other way and show a <em>tagline of honor</em> for the top N percent of users.</p>  <hr>  <p>Rather than removing accept rate, I propose replacing it with a citizenship percentage or level,  based on the above criteria. This would be a powerful motivator for better sites, and gives much more useful context for the question.</p>  <p>It is not that displaying accept rate was bad, so much as <em>incomplete</em>. I always had plans to circle back and improve it to be a citizenship level.</p>  <p>Displaying this metric on questions might help participants think of the game at a bit higher level. <strong>What is more useful to the longer term health of a community: a single ok question, or an engaged community member who assists and participates -- as a citizen, not just another drive by hit and run?</strong></p> 	Super Downvote?

duplicate	A method for the OP to accept comments?<blockquote>   <p><strong>Question</strong>: What if the author of a question can accept a comment?</p> </blockquote>  <p><em>The problem</em>:  Time and time again, answers are posted as a comment.  Usually, the person who commented has the best of intention (e.g. it was a trivial answer [to the answerer], and they weren't sure if the OP would immediately edit the question after the comment).  But this leaves the frustrating situation of an unanswered question with a perfectly good answer.</p>  <p>This problem accumulates over the years.</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em>Candidate solution</em>:  The OP can just "accept" the comment, after which a duplicate of the comment is made an accepted CW answer, with a preface indicating that it was originally a comment, e.g. <code>This answer was originally a comment posted by [[blah]] that has been accepted by the author of the question.</code></p> </blockquote>  <p>Comments on this scheme:</p>  <ul> <li>The author of the comment has indicated they're not interested in gaining/losing reputation through their comment (thus CW answer).</li> <li>The original comment is still there.</li> <li>If desirable, the "author" of the accepted question could be a "bot", so the answer is not attributed to a genuine account.  (I suppose it would already be technically possible for Joe Blow to create a script for a bot that creates an answer from a comment in the proposed way.)</li> </ul>  <hr>  <p>A similar question was asked before <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1555">here</a> (over 3 years ago), and in numerous other questions which have been deemed "duplicates" (<a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7420">here</a>, <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/77110">here</a> and <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/100729">here</a>; see also <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66499">here</a>), so there seems to be demand for such a feature.  The answers to these questions seem (to me, at least) quite weak:</p>  <ul> <li>"ask the commenter to add the comment as an answer"</li> </ul>  <p>The OP already did this by asking the question in the first place.  And what if the author of the comment doesn't respond (or takes a long time to respond)?  This also adds more chit-chat irrelevant to the question.</p>  <ul> <li>"add an answer of your own, referring to the comment, and accept it."</li> </ul>  <p>A hacky workaround.  How could this possibly be better than accepting a comment?  (Yet, this is the most up-voted response.)  Moreover, this adds to the user's list of "answers" (thus making the user's page harder to look through).</p>  <ul> <li>"When i leave a comment, i do so because i want to leave a comment."</li> </ul>  <p>Great; now what about everyone else?  In the immortal words of the FAQ: "Other people can edit my posts?!"  And it's not even an edit, it's copying the post from one box to another (a more hacky version of which is regarded as the "accepted" method).</p> 	suggestions: Changing 'add comment' title to 'add comment/suggestion'<p>I've noticed that users (including myself a time or two) tend to focus on solving problems within the OP's code rather than answering the original question. This know can lead to confusing results when searching for answers since the chosen answer often solves the OP's problem yet doesnt  answer the actual question. Although this can be great help to the OP, it doesn't provide an archived answer as a Q/A is meant. I think promoting suggestions within the comments area would help guide this assistance away from the answers section.</p>  <p>For example, say an OP noticed that a UPD service was dropping packets and asked how to prevent the loss. A likely answer would be to use TCP, even thought this doesn't answer the underlying issue of preventing a UDP service from losing packets. TCP is a very good suggestion and in most cases the right choice - often leading to a solution - but is technically off-topic for a UDP related issue, and ultimately wrong for an answer as there are reliable UDP solutions. In such a case an individual developing a gaming or messaging system will have to wade through many questions with "just use TCP" as an answer.</p>  <p>I think another way to help guide suggestions away from answers would be an option where the OP can mark a comment as a 'solution' allowing users to receive similar points and badges as providing an answer.</p>

That doesn't solve anything really.</li> </ul>  <p>So my suggestion is some new point system called "Trust".</p>  <p>"Trust" points can be achieved mutually when your review votes conform to the rest of the community.</p>  <h3>For example</h3>  <p>A late answer pops up at the Late Answer review queue.</p>  <ul> <li>User A thinks it's a bad answer, and votes it down.</li> <li>User B thinks it's a bad answer, and votes to delete it, leaving a comment for the answerer.</li> <li>User C doesn't care, and votes it up, just to have another review point.</li> </ul>  <p>In the end of such day, Users A and B, would get N trust points, and User C would lose M trust points.</p>  <h3>What do you do if the opposite happens?</h3>  <ul> <li>User A thinks it's a bad answer, and votes it down.</li> <li>User B doesn't care, and votes it up, just to have another review point.</li> <li>User C doesn't care, and votes it up, just to have another review point.</li> </ul>  <p>I propose a less smart system for this case, you automatically ban users with "more than N% of upvoted reviews for X days", so for instance, if more than 80% of your reviews are consisted of upvotes, you'll be banned from reviewing for a week.</p>  <h3>Now for the real deal</h3>  <p>All users begin with a set number of trust points. Say 200. Those 200 Trust points would allow the user to review 20 items per day. If a user gains trust points, he'll be able to review <strong>more and more</strong> items per day per queue. If a user loses them, he'll be able to review <strong>less and less</strong>, and eventually <strong>none at all</strong>.</p>  <h2>Some Points</h2>  <ul> <li>Trust points can be either visible or invisible. If visible, a log, stating how each trust movements was earned, should be available as well (much like the reputation log).</li> <li>Trust points should have an aging mechanism on them. A conflict which caused me to lose 20 trust points yesterday, would only cost me 15 next week (for example). This allows the "no review" ban to be lifted gradually, and if the user is willing to shape up, he'll get more trust points in no time.</li> </ul>  <p>Your thoughts?

duplicate	Too many closed questions<p>I'm going to risk asking this question again.  Existing questions went in a different direction (language grammer, no support, or were arguing for their own question).</p>  <p>:Plea: If you agree with this question please up-vote it.  I put in significant effort to make better arguments than those in the past, yet I received an onslaught of down votes early on.  However, I have been getting several upvotes every month.  I'm hoping if it gets into positive territory, then people will at least be willing to have the discussion (which is what I thought meta.so was for).  I believe there are good questions on SO which are incorrectly being reduced to somebody not being able to choose between two different brands of dishwashers. :/Plea:</p>  <p>It would seem that if there is even the possibility of the question being subjective, it is closed.  These days there must be a dozen ways to code something, yet those questions are allowed to stand.  Yet the instant somebody asks a "what is a library that will do 'X' it is closed.  The irony is that these questions, even in their closed and decaying state, are often the most valuable to me.  Sometimes I'll test three or four third party components before I commit to one.  This is a time consuming process that I would gladly augment with the vote-validated answers that others might have.</p>  <p>Examples include:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/744966/any-open-source-c-sharp-ocr-library">Any open source C# OCR library?</a></li> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/151005/create-excel-xls-and-xlsx-file-from-c-sharp/2603625#2603625">Create Excel (.XLS and .XLSX) file from C#</a></li> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/408212/best-net-blog-engine">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/408212/best-net-blog-engine</a></li> <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/361271/best-free-controls-for-net/361331#361331">Best Free Controls for .NET</a></li> </ul>  <p>I'll concede that the last one is too general but I left it on there because even if it was free control that does 'X' it still would have been closed.</p>  <p>If these questions cannot be asked on stackoverflow proper, which subsite should be considered (keeping in mind that the other sides hardly get any where close to the SERP rankings that SO gets).</p>  <p>Does the asker need to explicitly ask the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/">"subjective" guidance questions</a> to avoid getting closed?:</p>  <ul> <li>Please explain “why” and “how”</li> <li>Please elaborate</li> <li>Please only share items that you have personal experience with.</li> <li>Please post any data you have relating to your experience</li> </ul>  <p>Isn't that a mess?  Shouldn't we be able to rely on the answerers to follow the guidelines instead and if they violate them make effective use of the down vote button beyond simply being wrong?  Why does all the burdon fall on the asker when it's the answerers that should know the rules and how they can best serve the asker without turning them away?</p>  <p>Are these questions even subjective?  It is a fact if a component meets a need.  "Best" is subjective, but isn't that inherent anyway?  Is anybody going to list the item they've already discarded for themselves?  Are we really going to let a single adjective decide a questions fate?  Isn't this easily cleaned up with comments?</p>  <p>I understand we're trying to avoid the wild west of a forum, but we're not debating politics here.  Many of these questions could be answered with "here's what I did and here's why".  We could restrict answers to things that are pulled directly from the examples on MSDN, but why exactly do we want to do that?</p>  <p>What is the guiding principle here?  If we want to help programmers save time and create better software, then things that stop them from getting to page 17 on a SERP should be included.</p>  <p>EDIT: </p>  <p>For those that chose to dismiss my examples as "shopping" questions please explain the difference between asking "How do I create an excel file from .net" (which there are dozens of un-closed examples of and "What is the best component for creating an excel file".  Doesn't one question simply acknowledge that the best candidate for an answer is likely going to be a component?  I assert that the examples found in <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/">Q&amp;A is Hard, Let’s Go Shopping!</a> do not apply here.  These are well established products.  I'm sure there are very few questions asking how to read a pdf file.  Imagine it's 1900 and somebody's asking about taking a picture.  People are going to talk about daguerreotype and dry plates.  It's not a simple as saying "camera."  These are the questions that people are asking and they certainly follow a Q&amp;A format.</p>  <p>If there is no place for subjectivity in SO, what is the point of the voting mechanism?</p>  <p>I'd also like the question reopened.  The referenced question is the same in spirit but does not contain any of the arguments or assertions that I have made and would like to discuss.</p> 	How can I encourage Stack Overflow to rein in the 'subjective' vigilantes?<p>I'm on SO pretty much every day researching something to do with programming, and over the last month or two, I find I'm growing frustrated and a little disgusted at how many interesting questions have been closed as "not a good fit" or "too subjective".</p>  <p>I think there is a confusion between "subjective" and "calls for judgement". To me one of the <em>most</em> valuable things about SO is the tremendous breadth and depth of experience of the members, and experience translates into smart decisions and advice, and that advice cannot always be asked for, or expressed in terms of, bald facts and data.  It's going to be 'subjective'.</p>  <p>I don't think SO should be Wikipedia. I think that if I could ask a question to a group of skilled programmers sitting around a table at lunch, and get interesting, valuable answers, then I don't care whether the question or the answers are 'subjective', I think that question should equally well be fair game for Stack Overflow.</p>  <p>I would like to see a mechanism whereby people who vote to close a question lose reputation when somebody expresses interest in that question or its responses.</p>  <p>How can I, or can I, influence this aspect of SO?</p>

Perhaps it should not be accepted in Stack Overflow, I agree.</p>  <p>But I would really appreciate to have access to a site where I could ask those kind of questions. Ideally, the site will have a similar well tuned awards system as Stack Overflow. Also it would be nice if that site would have a very nice popularity as Stack Overflow.

I don't have much sympathy for folks who ask a question and then leave for the weekend, but if you're responsive to criticism then you really should be able to step away for a cup of coffee before returning to the question. I think the 20K "instant delete vote" privilege is being misused in some cases; I'd prefer to not throw the baby out with the bathwater by taking it away entirely, but some amount of discretion needs to be applied if it's to remain.</p>  <h2>Background</h2>  <p>Originally - as laid out in <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/the-stack-overflow-question-lifecycle/">The Stack Overflow Question Lifecycle</a> - there was a fairly generous review period after a question got closed:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>5) Once closed, the question can be reopened by voting to open in the same manner. If the question garners five (5) votes to reopen, the process starts over at step #3.</p>      <p>6) If question remains closed for 48 full hours, it is now eligible for deletion.</p> </blockquote>  <p>If a question didn't get fixed and reopened in two days, then it seemed a pretty good bet that it wouldn't be fixed - so, fair game for folks looking to clean up the clutter a bit. I know I certainly made good use of this as a 10k user. Then, <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/69989/propose-a-new-20k-reputation-privilege/70044#70044">this happened</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Remove the 2 day limit on voting to delete closed questions.</p>      <p>20K users should have enough about them to know when a question should be deleted rather than leaving it closed.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Note that the <em>request</em> was for the removal of the waiting period to <strong>vote</strong> - but the <em>implementation</em> went ahead and removed the waiting period for actual <strong>deletion</strong>. So what was intended as an expedient way for savvy folks looking at an unsalvageable question to save themselves the trouble of revisiting it later became a tool that <em>breaks the feedback loop between askers and the community</em>. </p>  <h2>How big of a problem is this?</h2>  <p>It's not huge, but it's significant: </p>  <ul> <li>1043 questions asked in the past 30 days have been deleted "early" by voters. Some of them are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14934057/android-developer-with-3-years-of-experience">ridiculously bad</a> - exactly the sort of rubbish that ChrisF had in mind when proposing this feature. Many are just <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15120308/implement-jquery-cookies">run-of-the-mill poor questions</a>. </li> <li>221 had at least one up-vote, </li> <li>112 had a score >=0 after being closed. </li> <li>52 were asked by folks with at least 1000 reputation on SO. </li> <li>395 had at least one answer.</li> <li><strong>186</strong> had at least one up-voted answer.</li> </ul>  <p>You can review all the questions here if you're interested (and have at least 10K on SO): <a href="http://jsbin.com/isobux/1" rel="nofollow">http://jsbin.com/isobux/1</a></p>  <h2>What should be done?</h2>  <p>Well, if you're reading this, have over 20K reputation on SO and you're in the habit of casting delete votes on questions when you close them... <strong>Stop deleting stuff early if it's not egregiously bad.</strong> In particular, if you're voting to close it's really not hard to go back through your close votes and vote to delete after a couple of days - this <em>wasn't</em> possible when the 20k privilege was introduced. </p>  <p>Beyond that, I'm open to suggestions: </p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/148204/can-we-get-some-more-review-queues-questions-with-delete-votes-recently-close">Review queues</a> (how would this work?)</li> <li>The original "delayed deletion" idea</li> <li>Get rid of early deletion entirely in favor of the auto-deletion that goes with spam and offensive votes.</li> <li>?</li> </ul> 	Would it be possible to get a site like my earlier idea of a books.stackoverflow.com through Area 51?<p>A while back, <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/614/can-we-have-a-books-stackoverflow-com">I proposed a books.[so/su/sf].com for books reviews and such</a>. The common suggestion was "make it a hosted version". The general idea in this hosted version was that each "question" would be a book and some metadata (author, title, image of the cover, ISBN number, links to booksellers, etc) and the "answers" would be reviews that could be voted up or down based on helpfulness. Then Stack Exchange came out - it could have been done with SE1.0 when you didn't have the approval process. But now, Area 51 stands between an idea being proposed and actually being given a Stack Exchange.</p>  <p>I'm a bit busy now between work, my own proposal on Area 51, the 2 closed betas I'm involved in, and my 1 commitment that's still waiting for beta. But I wanted to ask the community - how can I actually get this through the initial stage if I (or someone else with more time) were to propose this on Area 51? There aren't enough on-topic/off-topic questions and what is and is not acceptable is very well defined with very little (if any) gray areas.</p> 
non-duplicate	jQuery UI effects deactivated if too many ignored tags<h2>Original question, shortened for clarity</h2>  <p>It's been a few days that jQuery is inactive on the Stack Overflow pages I load. First I thought it was because my network was blocking some servers hosting the JavaScript code, but today being annoyed, I opened the Firefox console and saw that jQuery has a <code>too much recursion</code> error.</p>  <pre><code>[...] [14:00:37,946] GET http://static.adzerk.net/Advertisers/2322.jpg [HTTP/1.0 304 Not Modified 128ms] [14:00:38,022] too much recursion @ http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.2/jquery.min.js:16 [...] </code></pre>  <h2>Oct 2011 update</h2>  <p>The bug came back.

non-duplicate	Allow more than one answer to be accepted<p>Sometimes, after a few days, there are two or three good answers to a question, or answers which are very much like each other. It can be hard to choose which to accept. I think that after two days, you should be able to accept up to three answers, and the 15 points should be divided between the three answerers.</p>  <p>(Maybe this could be limited to only accepting answers you have upvoted yourself.)</p> 	Why was my question about jQuery keypress events closed as not a real question?<p>Someone thought that my <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12827408/whats-the-theory-behind-jquery-keypress-keydown-keyup-black-magic-on-macs" title="Closed question">question</a> was an attempt at a discussion. It was not. I was asking for specific answers about books or other documentation that would help me with Javascript event handlers. I even went back and edited the question to make it more question-y. It hasn't been reopened. Not that I would care, but I got a notice saying that my reputation had been besmirched by the closing of this question. Is there any recourse?</p> 
duplicate	Add ability for OP to "confirm" their question as a duplicate<p>Currently, when we vote to close a question as being a duplicate it provides a comment with a link to the duplicate question. The OP then has the option to follow that link to review the question.</p>  <p>As it stands, a question requires 5 votes to close (though I assume admins/mods can close as duplicate immediately?). The problem with requiring 5 votes is that a question might not always get all 5 votes.</p>  <p>Now, this is good from the point of view that we want multiple reputable people to agree it should be closed. But there are likely some instances (I would assume quite a few) where a question has been voted as duplicate, but not enough times to close. However, the OP may have already reviewed the possible duplicate, found it to be a match (and therefore solved their problem), but we are still stuck with an open, unanswered duplicate that the OP doesn't care about anymore.</p>  <p>So my proposition is to have a feature that allows the OP to say "I confirm this is a duplicate, my problem has been solved, this question can be closed". This could be an option that only becomes available once a duplicate vote has been logged. If multiple questions are identified as duplicates, then the OP should select which one was the one that solved their problem so the closed question can be correctly linked.</p> 	Grant the OP a binding close as duplicate vote<p>Since the <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/166707/changes-to-close-as-duplicate-part-deux">changes</a> to the close as duplicate mechanism it is a lot more visible to the OP that there is/might be a duplicate to their question. Empirically, I've noticed a lot more people agreeing, in the comments under their question, that their question is a dupe. </p>  <p>For instance, <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/193912/should-questions-about-se-site-features-be-moved-from-all-other-metas-to-so-meta#comment608428_193912">here</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/WOnC2.png" alt="Agreement"></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'm aware that allowing <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/10363/allow-question-askers-to-close-their-own-questions-unilaterally">a binding close vote</a> is <a href="/questions/tagged/status-declined" class="post-tag moderator-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;status-declined&#39;" rel="tag">status-declined</a> (back in the stone age) but now Stack Exchange is so much larger, and Stack Overflow is groaning under the weight of questions, I think this should be <em>partially</em> revisited.</p>  <p>Based on the principle that the simplest way to keep a site clean is to have as many people as possible nibbling away, I propose that the OP gets granted a binding close-as-duplicate vote.</p>  <p>It should simply be an additional line in the banner, which is <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/166527/stop-generating-possible-duplicate-comments/167980#167980">shown only to the question asker</a>. It might be something like this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>This question may already have an answer here:<br>   &nbsp; "<a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/10363/allow-question-askers-to-close-their-own-questions-unilaterally">Allow question askers to close their own questions unilaterally</a>" <em>3 answers</em><br>   &nbsp; Does this fully answer your question?  <em>Yes</em> / <em>No</em></p> </blockquote>  <p>I'm not wedded to the <em>Yes</em> / <em>No</em> thing I just can't think of a better way at the moment.</p>  <p>Clicking on <em>Yes</em> would take the OP to the close as duplicate dialogue with that question highlighted. If there are multiple duplicate questions you'd need to ask the OP multiple times. A <em>No</em> could be used to track the relative success of the project, i.e.</p>  <ol> <li>Whether the question subsequently gets closed.</li> <li>Whether the question gets reopened again.</li> <li>How many times the OP actually clicks.</li> <li>How many times the OP disagrees with the analysis of the community.</li> </ol>  <p>Potentially, a <em>No</em> could be used to open a comment dialogue asking the OP to explain <em>why</em> they think their question is not a duplicate thereby stopping them simply putting <em>"this is not a duplicate"</em> in the question and formalising this process somewhat. Not sure about this idea...</p>  <p>I do not think this should be restricted by reputation, anyone should be able to close their own question as a duplicate. It gives people with lower reputation a more positive experience of the closing process and emphasises the importance of duplicate finding.</p>  <p>Most importantly, self-closes should <em>not</em>, initially, count towards the question ban. We can help new users learn how to use a lot more of the site than they might otherwise see and encourage them to search for duplicates more thoroughly. If the OP then goes on to do the same thing 10 times in a row then you can start using it toward the ban as they're obviously using the users as a personalised search service but at least the first 3-4 times this should not have any effect.</p>  <p>This question is, deliberately, only requesting 20% of the linked question (from 2009) and then only based on the new UI. The linked question asks for binding migration votes etc, which I do not want to see and I am not requesting a binding close-as-duplicate for the OP until someone else has already voted to close (though I think if the OP has 3k rep this might be allowable). This, I hope, addresses the concern's raised in the linked question and explains why this is not a duplicate of that question.</p> 
non-duplicate	Reputation Distribution by Location<p>Is there a way to find out the users with the highest reputation, in a given location?

If you look at my Stack overflow account you will see that I'm actually quite helpful and have a high reputation, frankly, I'm still wondering why I'm banned from asking in the first place... But, if there is a way, I would like to ask either to close this account and Start fresh, or to wipe this account of any wrongs, and start fresh.</p>  <p>Please, have some decency, don't close this because its "off topic" or "beggy", honestly, theres no other way (that I know of (and I would gladly be corrected)) to ask the community, and the admins for help.</p>  <p>So, thank you in advance :)</p>

For potential answerers to be apprised there services are no longer needed, why isn't there a "This question is now moot" element that could be clicked/pressed?</p>  <p>As an example, this question of mine:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19694934/why-am-i-getting-the-remote-server-returned-an-error-405-method-not-allowed">Why am I getting &quot;The remote server returned an error: (405) Method Not Allowed&quot; with this code?</a></p>  <p>I no longer need an answer, as I've solved it myself, but not really in a way that I would want to mark the solution as an answer to the stated problem. At the same time, I don't think the question needs to be deleted; I would just like to mark it as solved, so that nobody has to read through the voluminous first part only to see that it is no longer an issue.</p>

Can't they both find a home in the header links?</p>  <p>The current situation, where the chat link is replaced by the blog link whenever there is a blog post &lt; 24 hours old, is not a good solution:</p>  <ul> <li>The chat link disappears and reappears for a reason that has absolutely nothing to do with chat.  This is confusing.</li> <li>On some sites, there may be a blog post every couple of days - or at times (e.g. when a related conference is happening) every day.  This means that the chat link is permanently or nearly-permanently hidden.</li> </ul>  <p>It seems like there is plenty of room in the header, even if you have a long username, vast amounts of rep and numbers of badges, and access to the mod tools.  If more space is required, perhaps the search box could give up some space for its chat friend?  (The size of the search box only effects the click/tap target area, since the box expands when it has focus).</p>  <p>There's a chat link in the meta header, but chat isn't just a place for those that participate in meta.  Indeed, encouraging users to take part in chat is a great way to get them more involved so that they eventually do end up taking part in meta.</p>  <p>The chat links in the sidebar of some question pages (I'm guessing it's questions that have multiple answers?) are prominent, but this isn't as useful as having the link at the top of every page.</p> 	Field labels in wrong place on Careers when adding new "other" project<p>I'm on Chrome 21.0.1180.57 on Mac OS X 10.6.8. When I add a new project to my careers profile, in the "other" category (so not github, codeplex, etc.), the labels are in weird places and hence I wound up putting my role in the technologies field.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bQ8DR.png" alt="screenshot"></p> 
non-duplicate	"This is just a test" - leaked<blockquote>   <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>   <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/157768/a-test-tells-you-theres-5-close-votes-already">A test tells you there’s 5 close votes already</a>  </p> </blockquote>    <p>I notice that sometimes there are audit tests in the review queues (First Posts).</p>  <p>Sometimes, I believe I have seen this 3 times now, there will be 5 close votes visible. Whenever it shows 5 close votes, it leaks the fact that it is a test.</p>  <p>At the bottom of the post, you see <code>share | edit | close(5) | flag</code>. If there are 5 close votes, it would already be closed and would not appear in the review queue... unless it is a test!.</p>  <p>Therefore, in these cases, it should never display 5 close votes, or else it tips the reviewer that they are being tested.</p> 	Show original message on click, inline, for chat replies<p>When somebody replies to an older message in chat, you have to click the "in reply to" arrow and jump to the message to get the context. That makes you leave the current position in the transcript, and old content possibly even needs to be loaded first. That's often a bit disrupting, especially when you're reading through the transcript.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.discourse.org" rel="nofollow">Discourse</a> has a nice "inline quoting" feature. When you reply to a post, you see a "in reply to" button:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/AmK61.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>When you click it, the original message is opened inline:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/RmefC.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>Would something like that make sense for chat? It would be much more minimalistic of course, just fading in the original message above the reply button.

Most of the others at the top have activity from just a few minutes ago.</p>  <p>The first time I noticed, they were stuck at positions 2 and 4.

Nothing is ever perfect.... ultimately the question is whether it is SO bad that it REALLY deserves to be downvoted to a -6 in its current state?... Why should mine be picked in particularly with -5? there are lots of really really horrible ones with no downvote.... and you provably dont downvote them every single one of them.</p>  <p>I tried to help and I tried to posted here to get feedback and help not to get further downgraded by people who has nothing to do but bully. That kind of behaviour goes against SO.</p>

duplicate	Where to or how to ask "Best of" Questions for what software tools to use<p>I am wondering where is a good place or how is a good way to ask a question on what software tools to use for a specific task.</p>  <p>A lot of the time when searching for information on these types of problems stackoverflow comes up with the top and actually useful discussions and answers, but the question is locked.</p>  <p>I completely understand the point of discouraging "best of" or list questions as discussed in this question (<a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/112327/exceptional-cases-for-list-questions">Exceptional cases for list questions</a>) and agree they often aren't constructive enough to justify the effort in moderating them.</p>  <p>What I am wondering is where is the right place to have a discussion like this? Stackoverflow has a good and active community so perhaps there is another section or related site I can ask less specific questions. And I do find some value in reading people's opinions, even if subjective on issues like this.</p>  <p>Here are some examples of the kind of questions I mean: </p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15376/whats-the-best-uml-diagramming-tool">What&#39;s the best UML diagramming tool?</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/91445/best-ide-for-ruby-on-rails">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/91445/best-ide-for-ruby-on-rails</a></p>  <p>First results in google when searching for those subjects and some useful discussion.</p>  <p>Perhaps asking a question like this but with a strict and detailed specification it might be considered a valid and reasonable question to ask on stackoverflow; perhaps it's just a case of re-thinking how to ask a question. Or perhaps there's a more relevant place for this kind of discussion. Please let me know what you think.</p> 	How can I encourage Stack Overflow to rein in the 'subjective' vigilantes?<p>I'm on SO pretty much every day researching something to do with programming, and over the last month or two, I find I'm growing frustrated and a little disgusted at how many interesting questions have been closed as "not a good fit" or "too subjective".</p>  <p>I think there is a confusion between "subjective" and "calls for judgement". To me one of the <em>most</em> valuable things about SO is the tremendous breadth and depth of experience of the members, and experience translates into smart decisions and advice, and that advice cannot always be asked for, or expressed in terms of, bald facts and data.  It's going to be 'subjective'.</p>  <p>I don't think SO should be Wikipedia. I think that if I could ask a question to a group of skilled programmers sitting around a table at lunch, and get interesting, valuable answers, then I don't care whether the question or the answers are 'subjective', I think that question should equally well be fair game for Stack Overflow.</p>  <p>I would like to see a mechanism whereby people who vote to close a question lose reputation when somebody expresses interest in that question or its responses.</p>  <p>How can I, or can I, influence this aspect of SO?</p> 
non-duplicate	Is it reasonable to upvote in order to counter what I think is an unjustified downvote?<p>Sometimes I see a question that has been downvoted and I don't agree with the downvote at all (for example if a comment that explains the downvote shows a misunderstanding of the question, or if I think it's an interesting question that I'd like to hear the answer to), but I don't think the question deserves an upvote either. Sometimes I upvote it just to get it back to zero score.</p>  <p>Is this the wrong behavior? I wonder if I'm doing harm by "hiding" the fact that someone has downvoted a question.</p> 	Position of HTML attributes breaks embedding images<p>I want to embed an image of this beautiful unicorn.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YHnAW.png"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YHnAW.png"/></p>  <p>Perfect! Now, it's a little too … majestic, so I'd like to make it smaller. Markdown doesn't support it, but we can use HTML, right?</p>  <pre><code>&lt;img width="100" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YHnAW.png"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p></p>  <p>… but where's the image? It's just not displayed! Check the source code of this question to see it. So, let's shuffle those attributes around:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YHnAW.png" width="100"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YHnAW.png" width="100"/></p>  <p><strong>Now it works!</strong> Obviously, the attribute position matters, and the image is just not displayed. As we all know, the position of attributes shouldn't matter, therefore, please make it possible to specify <code>width</code> (and other allowed attributes) anywhere inside the tag.</p> 
duplicate	Question answered in comments indicator<p>In the unanswered section of many sites there are a lot of questions that have 0 answers but when you go and look at them someone has suggested an answer in the comments, this creates unnecessary questions to be put in the unanswered section, thus clogging it up. To fix this would it be possible to put a button next to each comment(A little check mark or something along those lines)that would indicate if that comment solved the askers problem. If this is the case one of two things could happen.</p>  <p>1:     The correctly chosen comment could be converted into an answer and then either be automatically chosen as the right answer or just put up as a answer.</p>  <p>2:     The question still technically will have 0 answers but it will be moved out of the unanswered category, allowing for actual unanswered questions to be in there.</p> 	Marking comment as an answer?<p>Sometimes, a question is perfectly solved by suggestion or actual resolution given in "comments" under it. In such case, how to mark that answer (comment) as "Accepted Answer"? Due to this, the question remains unanswered even if solution is provided in comment.</p> 
duplicate	Am I the only one for whom SO has became the rubber ducky?<p>Not seeking answers, just drawing attention to somewhat positive effect of StackOverflow I have noticed recently.</p>  <p>Today, for some fifth time in a row I didn't post a question I started typing. Once again I found my answer while halfway through.</p>  <p>The process goes like this:</p>  <ul> <li>State my problems.</li> <li>State tools available for solving them that are at my disposal, and the constraints.</li> <li>State possible solutions and why they are not viable. Discuss why they are not viable; how each obstacle is insurmountable given accessible tools, constraints and my knowledge, or how standard solutions to them will not work.</li> <li>Find one with standard solutions that will work.</li> <li>Enjoy my solution, cancel posting the question and just proceed with my work.</li> </ul>  <p>Rubber ducky to be efficient must be believable. You must overcome the suspension of belief when explaining things to the ducky. You must believe the ducky can answer and help. A real rubber ducky doesn't really cut it for me, but SO works quite well!</p> 	Beginning to ask a question on Stack Overflow actually helps me debug my problem myself<p>Beginning to ask a question on Stack&nbsp;Overflow actually helps me debug my problem myself, especially while trying to formulate a coherent and detailed enough question body in order to get decent answers.</p>  <p>Is this common?</p> 
duplicate	Are answers no longer sorted by vote count<p>I am not sure when this happened (or if its just my imagination), but lately I've been noticing that answers aren't sorted by their vote counts. I noticed this on couple of questions that I answered my question had the highest rating but wasn't on top. So was this feature never there and I was living in an illusion (in which case I apologize)? Or has something changed? I personally think sorting by upvotes count is a good idea.</p> 	Answers no longer sorted by score/votes<p>For me at least, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18002916/how-to-make-a-list-of-lists-using-a-str">this question</a> has answers that are not sorted by score:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DTn0K.png" alt=""></p>  <p>Is this normal?

non-duplicate	What is the benefit of useful comment votes?<p>What is the benefit of getting a certain number of upvotes on <strong>comments</strong>? The tooltip says it means that the comment is "useful", but how is someone rewarded for posting useful comments?</p> 	Bug: New "Vote on more question" messages appear when voting on answers to your own questions<p>"You haven't voted on questions in a while; questions need votes too" appears even on your own questions, which you cannot upvote. It should appear as a reminder only when voting on answers to questions that you can actually upvote.</p> 
duplicate	Relative value of reputation<p>Is there a way to find out the percentile (in the reputation distribution) of a person's reputation on a specific site?</p>  <p>The actual meaning of, say, 5k reputation, is different depending on the specific site, but the percentile (e.g., 50% - median - vs 5% - i.e., 95% of users have smaller reputation) should be more comparable.</p>  <p>EDIT: The information is <em>almost</em> available as <a href="http://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/year/stackoverflow">rank</a> but should be as percent in addition to rank (being in top 1,000 out of 10k is very different than 1,000 out of 100k).</p>  <p>Also, I think the percentile should be appended to raw reputation everywhere, i.e., instead of <code>foo 1234</code> it should be <code>foo 1234 (33%)</code> if 33% of users on the site have reputation over 33%.</p> 	How to check user's other time period percentile?<p>At the user's info, there is a percentile status like</p>  <blockquote>   <p>top 3% this year</p> </blockquote>  <p>Is there a way how to check other (week, month, quarter, all time) periods percentile?</p> 
non-duplicate	View questions by comments<p>I can see my comments by clicking <strong>activity -> comments</strong>. However, I never have only one comment per question. If I have commented a lot on a question looking over all questions that I have seen becomes difficult.</p>  <p>I want to treat all comments on a question as being the same and therefore see only one, representative, comment to draw a question. That is, if I had 100 comments per question, I want to see only one.</p>  <p>Is this possible?</p> 	Best practices for denoting keyboard shortcuts<p>(Well, there actually is a <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/19145/denoting-keyboard-shortcuts-in-stackoverflow-questions-answers">Q on this topic</a> with a [faq] tag.

It's expectable (and often appropriate) that users will mention them all over the post.  In every sentence, on every line. Single keys. Combinations. Lists of them. And with logic in between.</p>  <p>There should be consensus on how shortcuts should be denoted properly, without interrupting the text flow.  As far as I have read, opinions vary on this topic. This is not a simple question. Therefore I believe the consensus should be written, possibly as a guide on this in FAQ.</p>  <p>I'll try to compile list of current possibilities, with notes on potential dangers:</p>  <ul> <li><p>just type <code>Ctrl+Shift+T</code> like there`s no markup</p>  <ul> <li><p>breaks readability of English text around</p></li> <li><p>can lead to ambiguities with keys which name has a meaning (space, Windows, Enter)</p></li> </ul></li> <li><p>use italics <code>_Ctrl+Shift+T_</code> or bold <code>**Ctrl+Shift+T**</code></p>  <ul> <li>can easily destroy readability, especially if we need those for their intended use</li> </ul></li> </ul>    <ul> <li><p>use <code>&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;T&lt;/kbd&gt;</code></p>  <ul> <li><p>distracts attention from the text</p></li> <li><p>with its current presentation style, it has problems with line spacing: one can easily end up with a Mah-Jong board (see Q mentioned above)</p></li> <li><p>destroys readability of plain-text markup source (that's why Markdown exists in the first place, right?)</p></li> </ul></li> <li><p>use Emacs-like <code>C-S-t</code> style</p>  <ul> <li><p>not sure everybody will understand them</p></li> <li><p>without proper use of rules, it will become ambiguous (e.g. <em>Ctrl+Alt</em> vs. <em>Ctrl+A</em>)</p></li> </ul></li> <li><p>invent new markup</p>  <ul> <li>that was a joke, it could only make things worse</li> </ul></li> </ul>  <p>What are some good/best practices on this?

All other answers which say it is or provide   algorithms are WRONG (naturally with the assumption that operations   like + - * and / should provide correct decimal answers.</p>      <p>Reason: The decision to round either upward or downward depends if the   next digit is either 0.49999999999999 or 0.5000000001. As floats are   always incorrect approximations to both values, you simply cant,   either we would not have the need to use decimal or money classes.</p>      <p>The C# documentation even cites an example:   <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/75ks3aby.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/75ks3aby.aspx</a></p>  <pre><code>Notes to Callers  Because of the loss of precision that can result from representing  decimal values as floating-point numbers or performing arithmetic operations on floating-point values, in some cases the Round(Double, Int32) method may not appear to round midpoint values to the nearest even value in the digits decimal position. This is illustrated in the following example, where 2.135 is rounded to 2.13 instead of 2.14. This occurs because internally the method multiplies value by 10digits, and the multiplication operation in this case suffers from a loss of precision. </code></pre>      <p>And as float has only 24 bits, it means that 16 777 216+1 == 16777216.   You are screwing up if you use floats for decimal points.</p>      <p>EDIT: Because it seems that noone wants to see the problem, here the   proof:</p>      <p>The very first problem is that the algorithms here are broken:   AlmostEquals(0.06f, 0.14f, 1) = true.</p>      <p>The reason is that the original poster asked explicitly for equal   decimal places. But even if we use a special round function, there is   no way to escape the problem.</p>      <p>I used VC 2008 to print out the correct values of the Math.pow   function. The first is the precision parameter, the second the hex   value of the resulting float and the third is the exact decimal value.</p>      <p>1 3dcccccd 0.100000001490116119384765625</p>      <p>2 3c23d70a 0.00999999977648258209228515625</p>      <p>3 3a83126f 0.001000000047497451305389404296875</p>      <p>4 38d1b717 0.0000999999974737875163555145263671875</p>      <p>5 3727c5ac 0.00000999999974737875163555145263671875</p>      <p>6 358637bd 9.999999974752427078783512115478515625E-7</p>      <p>So you can try</p>      <p>AlmostEquals(0.0f, 0.100000001490116119384765625f, 1) or</p>      <p>AlmostEquals(0.0f, 0.0999999940395355224609375, 1)</p>      <p>and show me a function which is able to get correct answers for both   values and is generalizable.</p>      <p>I see here a little problem.</p> </blockquote>  <p>May I ask why ?</p>  <p>Even if you assume that my answer is <em>NOT</em> correct....</p>  <ul> <li><p>There is an answer: It is NO.

I made the change, saw my name as the last editor and for some reason looked at the edit history. </p>  <p>There was I, but no changes, and there was an edit by one of the Approvers, who had perhaps had an attack of conscience (or couldn't work out how Improve works either) and fixed-up the post by removing the thanks.</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/posts/21237584/revisions">http://stackoverflow.com/posts/21237584/revisions</a></p>  <p>There are some rough edges when there are simultaneous edits, mostly the consequences have been minor, but get three people doing different edits and quite a pickle might ensue.</p>  <p>Is there some sense in preventing other users editing during the grace period (I see that a lot, even with the small number of reviews I'm doing whilst the Edit Review is so frustrating)? </p>  <p>I've suggested a longer period previously, and comments to the OP that an Edit is needed (this was not liked, which is fair enough). </p>  <p>Blocking edits for the grace period would also reduce the confusion of the instant answer, near instant edit to fix a typo, and then comments-clash about whether an answer is appropriate given the question that has been asked (subsequent to the edit).</p>  <p>From reading, it seems that simultaneous edits are resolved in favour of the more substantial (characters) edit (I hope it includes markup). Little things are going wrong. If a post is actually pickled someone will likely notice: is that sufficient reason not to smooth off some edges with any simultaneous edits?</p> 
duplicate	Don't show answers when voting to close as duplicate on mobile<p>This originally started bothering me when voting to close as duplicate of a question which had deleted answers. I thought to myself, "Why on Earth am I being shown the deleted answers for this?" Why do I want to scroll through a bunch of deleted content that the average user won't even see when they get there?</p>  <p>After dealing with it more, it really doesn't seem clear to me why it loads answers at all. A mobile device just isn't friendly enough to be loading extremely long blocks of text like this. The question itself will suffice. If I wa t to see the answers, I can go to the question itself. Seriously, you try to close a question as a duplicate of the Formatting Sandbox on the mobile layout, see where that gets you...</p>  <p>Can the answers please be removed from the vote to close as duplicate dialog on the mobile layout?</p> 	Close as a duplicate on mobile: Lots of Vertical Scrolling<p>Attempting to use the site with a Nexus 4.  I came across a question that was a duplicate, so I found the dupe and voted to close.</p>  <p>The only problem:  <strong>the button is at the bottom of the modal.</strong>  While in mobile view, that means lots of painful scrolling all the way through the question <em>and</em> its answers.</p>  <p>On the normal site this isn't an issue:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1UkkS.png" alt="This is normal and okay - you don't have to scroll through the question."></p>  <p>...but on the mobile site...</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vTAi9.png" alt="It's all the way in the bottom corner!"></p>  <p>Here's an example:</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4vNgJ.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4vNgJ.jpg" width="30"></a></p>  <p>This definitely affects usability while on mobile.</p>

duplicate	User was removed ... Ok, why am I getting punished for it?<p>Today my reputation was decreased because of 'User was removed' criteria. </p>  <p>First of all the information provided about this on the reputation page is quite inadequate. </p>  <p>It does not explain, who got removed?(Don't care about this) but I would like to know where my points got deducted on which question and would like some more detailed explanation for all the points awarded or deducted by SO, I always have to go hunting now what does this mean.</p>  <p>Can we have a better messaging system for reputation? The main reason I am writing this question is that found out from what "User was removed" means. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>A user who voted for one of your posts had their account deleted   (either by choice or due to violating the network's Terms of Service).   As a result, all of their votes were undone, and the rep you gained   from them (or lost because of them) was revoked.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Some user broke the rules and got himself thrown out. </p>  <ul> <li>A user I am not associated with.</li> <li>A user I don't even know who he is.</li> <li>A user I have got nothing to do with.</li> </ul>  <p>Why am I getting punished for his acts?</p> 	Why do answerers get a penalty for user removal?<p>Today I was notified about a novel event regarding my reputation.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8XM1X.png" alt="Enter image description here"></p>  <p>It appears a user account was deleted, whose question was answered by me and also <strong>up-voted</strong>.

duplicate	Didn't you regret the "Association Trust"?<p>I was absolutely happy and also surprised, when I could see that after reaching 200 reputation points, I got +100 reputation for every sub-account. It's a very kind decision.</p>  <p>It also means that if someone reaches 200 reputation, you trust him so strongly that you clear most of the beginner's limits for them. </p>  <p>However, is 200 reputation enough for you to trust someone that strongly? Isn't it a bit few?</p> 	The association bonus should not enable users to vote on every site<p>The number of upvotes for a question is a flawed measure of question quality, one particular issue is that the amount of exposure a question gets matters a lot. Questions that were linked in the hot questions list tend to get an enormous amount of votes, much more than any questions gets organically on the site itself.</p>  <p>The kind of question that tend to get to the top spot of the hot questions list tend to be simpler, less technical questions with an appeal to a broader audience. The hot questions list distorts the voting even beyond the mere effect the increased views have. It exposes the question to users that might be interested in reading about that topic, but are not active users on the site and wouldn't have seen and voted on the post otherwise.</p>  <p>I think this distortion of voting is harmful, as the result might not be representative of the community of that specific site. For example, while I might enjoy reading some answers on Security.SE, I'm by far not qualified to actually evaluate them. If I voted there, my votes would not provide any actual value as I can only judge the answers in a very superficial way. Another example would be Skeptics where the community requires answers to cite references supporting their claim. This works very well and the community also votes that way, but the moment a question hits the hot questions list, voting becomes unreliable and answer not meeting our standard are upvoted anyway.</p>  <p>I think that this interaction between the hot questions feature and the low barrier to voting on sites where one didn't earn any reputation at all leads to a distortion of voting and dilutes the usefulness of post scores. </p>  <p>My proposal would be to not count the association bonus for the voting privilege. This means that in order to vote a user would have to get at least one upvote on an answer, two upvotes on a question or five accepted suggested edits. I think that this barrier is low enough to barely inconvenience anyone with a serious interest in the site, and significant enough to prevent drive-by voting by non-experts from the greater SE network.</p> 
non-duplicate	Directly support cross-site queries in the Data Explorer<p>Often you want to query some statistic for a user across all sites. For example, you might write a query to find your rejected suggested edits across all Stack Exchange sites.</p>  <p>To implement this, you would join on the network-wide user ID, across the tables corresponding to all the sites. (Doing it "properly" probably requires adding this as a column to each user table.)</p>  <p>Currently, it's possible to do this with a hack, by introspecting the system tables to see what sites exist, and using the output to write a query that joins across all the sites' tables. See:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/83570/allow-cross-site-queries-in-data-explorer">Allow cross-site queries in data explorer</a></li> <li><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/109438/how-can-i-write-a-cross-site-data-explorer-query-that-joins-databases-on-linked">How can I write a cross-site Data Explorer query that joins databases on linked accounts?</a></li> </ul>  <p>But this is hard to use and cumbersome. Furthermore, this makes it difficult to bookmark and share queries because the second query has to be manually updated each time a new site is added to the Data Explorer.</p>  <p>Please add support for doing these joins automatically. Ideally, it would allow arbitrary joins, but even supporting only joining on global ID will make a common use case easier.</p> 	Show you have flagged a post in the flag dialogue window<p>When I vote to close a question and I open back up the dialogue window it will say </p>  <blockquote>   <p>You voted to close this question {time} ago</p> </blockquote>  <p>which is fair enough.  </p>  <p>However, if I flag a post I will get told </p>  <blockquote>   <p>You have already flagged this post for moderator attention </p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>only after</strong> I try and submit a second flag.

duplicate	show why a post was off-topic in close-vote reviewing<p>I notice that when I review a post in the close-vote review queue that has been voted as off-topic, I only see at the top that the post was off-topic. I have no idea of finding out why it is off-topic unless I click "close", then select "off-topic" as the reason, then see which reasons have the blue marker that indicates other people voted like that. So I requested that instead of a generic message like "This question is off-topic", to see a message such as "Questions require valid code to reproduce the problem".</p> 	Show sub reasons in close review queue<p>Currently close vote review queue shows the top level close reason in the header, but some close reasons, for instance, off topic have very different sub reasons. For instance, "demonstrate minimal understanding" is different from "This question belongs on a different site in the stack exchange network".</p>  <p>It would be nice if sub close reasons were also shown.</p>

non-duplicate	Community ♦ user dismissing close-flags as helpful, stealing credit from mods<p>It seems like recent changes to the way flags are handled has introduced some strange behavior. </p>  <h2>A little bit of background</h2>  <p>Users who don't yet have the reputation to <em>vote</em> to close can flag for moderator attention, select "It doesn't belong here", and then select a close reason from the same set of choices available to close voters. These flags get added to the 10K queue, where they sit for a little while - if a 10K user agrees and <em>votes</em> to close, the flag is dismissed (as helpful) by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/-1/community">the Community user</a>. If nothing happens, the flag eventually "graduates" to the moderator flag queue... </p>  <h2>And therein lies the problem</h2>  <p>If a moderator responds to one of these "close" flags and closes the question without manually dismissing the flag, the Community user dismisses it as "helpful" and the moderator's flag handling count is <strong>not</strong> increased!</p>  <p><strong>A few months ago:</strong></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/K8Fsu.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p><strong>Today:</strong></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HM1RT.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>I would expect the flag, once having been shown in the moderator queue, to behave as any other flag - action on the post that results in automatic dismissal also attributes the dismissal to the moderator who dismissed it. </p> 	About tag [polyglot-programming]<p>Currently, there are 9 questions under <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/polyglot-programming" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'polyglot-programming'" rel="tag">polyglot-programming</a>. IMHO, the use of this tag is not justified for most of theses questions. For instance, one question relates to both C# and F#, and has these two tags.

duplicate	Migrating question to different .SE for lack of answers<p>I have used several .SE's which were very helpful. However to stay on topic for some questions I went to other .SE's which did not have the same number of active members due to which questions stay unanswered very long. If a question is suitable for several .SE's and at the most appropriate one it stays unanswered because of low population on that .SE, is that a good reason to migrate it to another (although less) suitable .SE?</p>  <p>Basically a .SE does not work as well as another if theres less people on it. Even though its more on topic on the less functioning .SE, its much more helpful to post it on the good functioning .SE. So you could say the less functioning .SE should not have been created, on the other hand you could say that all active people more engaged with subtopics on the busy .SE that better fit on the less functioning .SE should really spend more time there.</p> 	Deciding between slow beta sites and Stack Overflow<p>I posted <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18160095/difference-between-returning-false-or-true-first">this question</a>. I think it was probably a better fit for the <a href="http://codereview.stackexchange.com/">Code Review SE</a>, but for the reasons I cited in my question, I posted it on SO.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I deliberated whether to post this on code review or here. I came to   the conclusion that it is a straightforward question about PHP and   with the number of supporters here, it would likely get an answer, as   code review is slow and the question has a greater chance of not being   answered.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The answers and feedback have been amazing and, I believe, will add another good resource for visitors to the site.</p>  <p>I have attempted to be active on the Code Review SE, but there is not a great deal of interaction. </p>  <p>Can anyone suggest a way to support our Beta sites and yet still get good answers?</p> 
duplicate	How should I handle possible revenge downvotes?<p>I don't like such kind of questions on Meta, so I will try to make it a good question and describe all with a details.</p>  <p>Today I down-voted <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7469685/what-could-be-a-replacement-for-swf-movie-to-present-a-video-on-browser">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7469685/what-could-be-a-replacement-for-swf-movie-to-present-a-video-on-browser</a> added a comment with explanations why I down-voted it, and flag it as non constructive (my flag was marked as helpful). An hour later <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6731098/how-to-set-the-minimal-flash-player-version/6731282#6731282">one of my answers</a> was downvoted, without any comment left about the reason. Yes, that wasn't my best answer, but in my opinion it answers the question. Well, even if somebody considered my answer incorrect he could add the correct answer, or up-vote the competitive ones. I checked the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/388026/pkyeck?tab=reputation">users reputation</a> who made competitve answer, and he didn't get any rep today for that answer. </p>  <p>It was my second down-vote on Stack Overflow, so I was a little bit down, after that. I think who could considered my answer so completely wrong, and that I thought that maybe it was revenge down-vote. So I checked <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/578523/marcos?tab=reputation">reputation</a> of the user I down-voted today, and it was clear that he down-voted some answers today. After I checked that that user cast only 19 downvotes in 8 months, so chances were very big that this was revenge down-voting.</p>  <p>I came to this meta, and searched what I should do in this case. I found that most questions about down-votes, were closed as duplicates. After I found <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/100980/victim-of-revenge-downvoting">Victim of Revenge Downvoting</a>, and found that a team member of Stack Exchange suggested to cast a flag for moderator attention, and explain the situation there.</p>  <p>I did that, and create next flag:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I think after I down-voted this question (and a comment about this), the OP down-voted me in revenge; it's clear from his today's reputation and from timing of my down-vote of his question, and time when one of my answers was downvoted. I cannot be 100% sure about that, but if somebody can check this, and point him that it's not the good way to do.</p> </blockquote>  <p>As you can see, I didn't ask for returning any reputation, or banning that user, I just wanted, somebody to point him, that he did wrong. And after I get this respons on my flag: "declined - flags should only be used to make moderators aware of content that requires their intervention." So in the end I also lost 10 points of the flag weight.</p>  <p>After describing all situation in details, I want to know were exactly I was wrong here. And what should I do next time something like this happens?  </p> 	What can I do about downvotes cast in retaliation?<p>A user posted an answer on Stack Overflow which was incorrect.</p>  <p>I downvoted it (and upvoted the other correct answer besides my own), and told him why I downvoted it, and he proceeded to downvote my answer, unjustly.</p>  <p>What can I do about this? What are my options? </p>

duplicate	Auto-generate the "possible duplicate" comment when question is flagged as a duplicate<p>When someone votes to close a question as a duplicate, they provide a link to the potential duplicate and the system auto-generated a "possible duplicate of ..." comment.</p>  <p>Users who can't yet vote to close can flag the question as a duplicate instead. They also provide the link to the possible duplicate, but there's no auto-generated comment in that case. I think there should be - it would allow others (especially those with enough rep to vote to close) to avoid having to hunt down the link.</p>  <p>It might also be a good idea to include this question as an option in the close-as-duplicate dialog.</p> 	User flag showing up in comments<p>I just flagged a question as duplicate.

non-duplicate	Instant notifications on my desktop<p>I noticed the StackExchange button at the top-left of the screen which (on refresh) tells me everything that's going on as pertaining to me around the various sites.

duplicate	Is "Don't do it" a valid answer?<p>If someone asks how to do XYZ, and you think doing XYZ <em>at all</em> is a <strong>Bad Idea™</strong>, is it valid to post an answer saying so? You aren't answering the question, but instead, arguing the question's validity.  You <em>could</em> do this in a comment, but I don't think comments carry enough weight on occasion.</p>  <p>For example, I came across this today <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1176239/what-is-the-best-wiki-software-if-the-site-is-all-about-individual-people">SO1176239</a>; for those not wanting to link away:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I would like to build a wiki based website about professors, so that students can share information and check the reputation of the professor before working for him.</p> </blockquote>  <p>and I really wanted to post an answer that said, "I think this is a very bad idea". (In fact I did anyway, despite awareness that it could get myself flamed.)</p>  <p>Was I wrong? What should I have done instead?</p> 	What is the appropriate way to handle questions highlighting an ineffective approach?<p>What should be the appropriate reaction when someone ask for help, but the question shows major flaws in the code or design? I have the feeling that just "answering" is like helping them to go further in the wrong direction.</p>  <p>Here is a concrete example: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17966473/why-this-select-from-database-wont-work">why this SELECT * FROM database wont work?</a></p>  <p>The OP asked about a "SELECT that don't work". The approved answer solved the issue. But, as someone noticed in a comment the code has severe security implications. And there is several like that every days.</p>  <p>In order to provide an helpful, clearly identifiable, and appropriate/polite comment, is there a "repository" of standard comments for these cases? If not, we should think of it.</p>

If not can we add this feature?</p> 	Allow moderators to handle spam flags network-wide<p>There has been lots of discussion here about the sports-related spam.</p>  <p>On high volume sites, and sites with OCD^H^H^Hactive moderators, spam vanishes quickly.  Either the users flag it to oblivion, or the moderators see it or the flags, and take care of it.  In other words, the system works as intended.</p>  <p>On low volume sites, especially ones where moderators aren't as obsessive, spam can sit on the front page, even when it is flagged as such.  In these cases, a moderator isn't around to handle the flag and the post hasn't hit the 3 flag or 6 flag threshold.  While this isn't totally bad, Google and other spiders will occasionally crawl the site when spam is on the home page (<a href="https://twitter.com/df07/status/300250817473175552" rel="nofollow">this happened to Drupal Answers</a>).</p>  <h1>Proposal</h1>  <p>Allow moderators to handle spam flags, network wide.  I would also suggest a different flag indicator/counter in the header for all spam (ie, keep the yellow one for normal flag, but also put the red one in the header just for spam).</p>  <h2>Rationale</h2>  <p>Most spam is very identifiable.  There is very little judgment that needs to go into deciding whether a post about live streaming, fake handbags, or discount watches is an unsolicited advertisement.  All of the mods have been using the internet long enough to know what the deal is.</p>  <h2>Not Proposing</h2>  <p>I am <strong>not</strong> suggesting giving cross-network ability to moderators to delete/destroy accounts, just the ability to get spam deleted quicker, especially on lower volume sites.  Handling the users themselves is best address by other means.</p>  <h2>But what about revenge flags or improper spam flags?</h2>  <p>I think we have enough trust in our moderators to know whether to decline these types of flags, or to ignore them for another moderator.</p>  <h2>Won't this increase the workload for moderators?</h2>  <p>Yes, for some.  If there is a different indicator for spam, then I think that it won't affect us much.  With hundreds of moderators, I also think that there will always be <em>someone</em> around, and this queue will remain relatively empty.  Personally, I would be happy to help out during the particularly nasty spam attacks.</p> 
non-duplicate	Pseudo reversed concept for stackoverflow site<p>Hi all!</p>  <p>I'm wondering if following would work as a community site: </p>  <p>Instead of posting a question user posts a quick tip for how to achieve certain actions in certain conditions.

This is misleading: no matter how long one waits, or how many times one moves the pointer to and from the checkmark, this information will not be loaded. </p>  <p>I suggest displaying "The question owner accepted this as the best answer", without a date.

non-duplicate	Reputation decreased due to removal of random post<p>My reputation was decreased. When I look at the reason it says that the post was removed. But I don't think that I was by any means connected to that post. Has this happened to anybody else? </p>  <p>Or do I need to know something about Stack&nbsp;Overflow?</p> 	Code inserting popup window<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>  <p>I'm sure everyone over 2.500 reputation has at least once had a question where the user simply didn't understand how to insert/highlight his code. Which often results in either none-formatted code which would be the least problematic option or in wrong-formatted code which means that they abused the block-quote function for that. The last part is where the it gets ugly.</p>  <p>For example I'm quite active on the Android tag where users tend to post their entire layout files content (XML) and those layout files can be very long sometimes. Editing such questions by hand line per line can drive you nuts.</p>  <p><strong>Suggestion</strong></p>  <p>My suggestion would be to have a simple window pop up when the user hits the code button. In that window you have only a textarea where you can paste your code and then you hit submit it posts the entire content formatted as code (i.e. properly indented) at the cursors position.</p>  <p>What do you think?</p> 
non-duplicate	Rescind Review Votes by Audited Reviewers<p><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/188457/please-require-more-reviewers-on-first-posts">This question's first answer</a> has a comment by Brad Larson that indicates that there is a period of time between when a robo-reviewer starts doing bad reviews and hits an audit, stopping them. Is it possible to add a feature where a user who gets audited has their recent reviews put back into the appropriate queues? </p>  <p>The rationale here would be that recent reviews are probably bad and should not have been resolved. For the First Post/Late Answer/Low Quality queues where only one reviewer exists, this means that a robo-reviewer probably has had a significant negative impact. This could be tuned to a period (24 hours) or a certain number of reviews (10? 40?). Those queues are consistently empty, so it's probably unlikely to create a huge workload burden (though I don't know if there is a means to run actual numbers on that?). I'm not sure this would be a useful or easy change for the Close Vote queue.</p>  <p>Thoughts?</p>  <p>(Also, apologies if this is a dupe... was unable to find something hitting this potential strategy.)</p> 	Use ActionBar-PullToRefresh instead of Android-PullToRefresh<p>The app currently uses the library <a href="https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh" rel="nofollow">Android-PullToRefresh</a> by Chris Banes.

non-duplicate	Bookmark/Mark as unread<p>In the interest of people using SO as a research resource/tool it would be good to be able to mark questions as "unread" instead of just star them. That way you can work through your list of "unread" questions in order to learn about certain topics you are interested in marking them as read when you're done. Stared questions are more useful for questions you really like and want to keep an eye on.</p>  <p>E.g.

However, I have a few suggestions (mostly minor changes) that could make it a bit nicer.</p>  <ul> <li>There is no way to see (on that page) which badges I've earned multiple times — they all appear with a green checkmark. It would be nice to show something like "x 4" like in the badges section of the user profile page. For example:</li> </ul>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hlGLk.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <ul> <li>There is no way to see which badges <strong>can</strong> be awarded multiple times — you have to click on a specific badge to see yea or nay. It would be nice to have a small, simple icon next to badges that can be earned multiple times, similar to the checkmark showing which badges I've earned.</li> <li>The layout would be nicer if the number of recipients for each badge were in a separate column — since the badge images are different sizes, the overlap and ragged right alignment makes the numbers harder to read.</li> <li>An alternative view that groups badges by "achievement level" (gold/silver/bronze) would be nice, as would a view that groups progressive degrees of the same accomplishment.

The question had slightly fuddled grammar so I decided to look at its comments. The comment expansion text read "show 8 more comments" (all 8 comments were hidden).

duplicate	Flagging users who post useless comments<p>One of the things I find really annoying about Stack Overflow is that many users will post useless comments and others will upvote them. If someone doesn't think you did do your homework, then they have the right to flag a post as such, but they should not be allowed to post poor comments.</p>  <p>There should be a "flag as unconstructive" next to comments (and not just solutions posted). If some people are constantly in the habit of posting useless comments, penalties should be taken like locking them out of Stack Overflow for a few days. Then maybe they would think twice about making such comments. Just have a look at the comments on this post for example:</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18358769/reduce-this-code-to-a-simple-function-call">Reduce this code to a simple function call</a></p>  <p>People on Stack Overflow shouldn't be able to get away with this. If they don't like a post, they should either ignore it or flag it under some category.</p> 	What are valid reasons for flagging comments?<p>Because comment flags were historically some of the worst / least appropriately used flag types, we made comment flags require a <em>reason</em>:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ty7fB.png" alt="Comment flagging options"></p>  <p>Requiring a reason definitely helped improve existing comment flags that we now see.</p>  <p>The current default comment flagging reasons are</p>  <ul> <li>rude or offensive</li> <li>not constructive / off-topic</li> <li>obsolete</li> <li>too chatty</li> <li>other (requires text)</li> </ul>  <p>Do these default reasons capture -- without getting into obsessive detail -- the <em>most common, valid</em> reasons to flag a comment?</p>

non-duplicate	What should we do about potentially unanswerable questions?<p>I've seen this a few times on multiple Stack Exchange sites and it's bugged me.  I've wondered if the community has come to any consensus on how address and handle such questions.</p>  <p>Specifically, I've seen users ask questions that <em>might</em> not be answerable.  Some of these questions sit around and get up-voted, and up-voted-- people would like to know the answer but under certain circumstances these questions may not be answerable because they involve a level of knowledge that either no one can have, or such a small pool of people are capable of answering the question, there is a reasonable chance that such questions will almost certainly never be answered.</p>  <p>Arqade is good place to go to find some of these.  As such, consider the following questions as examples:</p>  <p><a href="http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/34014/what-would-cause-sauron-to-attack">What would cause Sauron to attack?</a></p>  <ul> <li>20 Upvotes and currently sits at the top of the Unanswered Questions list.</li> <li>What could be a good questions about an old Commodore 64 game.  The problem is this can probably only be discovered by reverse engineering the game or asking an original developer.  That's probably never going to happen.</li> </ul>  <p><a href="http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/19912/some-serious-sam-levels-end-prematurely">Some “Serious Sam” Levels End Prematurely</a></p>  <ul> <li>This question is well documented with 11 up votes.  </li> <li>The problem is that this is also a highly technical question about a closed-sourced game.  The only people who could probably debug or address this are the original developers.</li> </ul>  <p>I could probably find a few other questions on other sites with the similar flaws.  Usually they involve users of specific software, or hardware, asking extremely specific questions that only the originators of the software or hardware could address.  </p>  <p>As a community, what should we do with these types of questions?  After significant aging should we vote to close them?  Should we leave them and let them set at the top of the Unanswered Questions list for eons?  Should answers stating that the question is unanswerable be aloud for these very obscure questions, if that is the unfortunate truth?</p> 	How can a user become a non-owner of a chat room?<p>I observed that a user previously was among the owners of a chat room, but after some time, s/he disappeared from the owners list. </p>  <p>How can that happen?</p>

Of course, once I do so I see a page telling me to come back when the site goes into public beta. </p>  <p>If you know which sites I am committed to/following/active in private beta, etc. then why not use that information to hide a private beta button?</p> 	Provide a bulk-rollback mechanism for all features that can be bulk-approved<p>On Programmers, thanks to the <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/121484/149432">shiny new badge</a> no doubt, dozens of tag wikis were suggested that directly copied Wikipedia and Stack Overflow's tag wikis. This violates the attribution requirement of the CC-BY-SA license, and generally makes for a really crappy tag wiki.</p>  <p>Someone with approval access to the suggested edit queue approved these en masse without checking to see if the content was plagiarized or copied. This presents a problem, as we can't have plagiarized or copyright-violating content on the site.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, what took the approver about 2 minutes to do can't be easily undone: we have to go back into each tag wiki, blank out the full description, and come up with a dummy tag wiki excerpt (since you can't save a tag wiki with a blank excerpt).</p>  <p>This is—for lack of a better word—<em>insane</em>. I get the value and draw of having low-friction approval mechanisms, but there needs to be a way to easily roll it back when people get it really, really wrong.</p>  <p>Please, think of the <strike>children</strike> mods: don't let bulk approvals exist without an appropriate bulk rollback mechanism.</p>

duplicate	"This edit would have to be a suggested edit" / edit button grayed out<p>A couple of times recently when I attempted to edit a post while reviewing it from the "First Posts" queue, I received the following message when I tried to submit the form:</p>  <pre><code>This edit would have to be a suggested edit. (x) </code></pre>  <p>This is a rather cryptic message, considering that edits made from a review <em>are</em> suggested edits, subject to the same peer review process. There was no indication of how the edit would have to be submitted differently, much less why. I searched both help and meta for more information about this message, but came up empty.</p>  <p>The first time it happened, after I cancelled out I saw that someone else had just edited the post, so I thought maybe that's why I couldn't submit an edit from the review (and wondered why, if that's the case, the error message didn't just say that instead of telling me something that doesn't make any sense - that the edit I'm trying to suggest can't be submitted because it would have to be a suggested edit). However, the second time I received this message (last night, for this question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17894384/codeigniter-uploading-files-into-gallery-folder">Codeigniter Uploading files into gallery folder</a>), there was no other edit. So, I clicked the <strong>No action needed</strong> button and tried to edit the post outside the review process, only to discover that the <strong>edit</strong> link was grayed out. </p>  <p>I see several explanations of possible causes for graying out the edit link here: <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/91172/always-show-the-edit-button-on-questions/138944#138944">Always show the edit button on questions</a>. However, there was no tooltip when I hovered over the disabled link, and the edit queue was in the single digits.</p>  <p>A few minutes later, I noticed that the <strong>edit</strong> link was no longer grayed out, so I edited the post and my edit was accepted. </p>  <p>My best hypothesis based on my experience with the error so far and the explanations I've read here at meta is that someone submitted a suggested edit while I was reviewing the post, which (a) caused me to get the cryptic error message and (b) caused the <strong>edit</strong> link to be grayed out when I accessed the post the normal way. Then a few minutes later, the suggested edit was rejected, opening up the question for new edit suggestions.</p>  <p>Rather than speculating about it and trying to determine the answer scientifically, it would be helpful if someone could give me the answer (as <em>Seinfeld</em> fans might put it, "Why don't you just <strong><em>tell</em></strong> me why I can't edit the post?"). It would be even more helpful if the error message itself provided the explanation, or if the message were defined somewhere in the help pages. But, at the very least, hopefully there will soon be an answer on meta to enlighten people who scratch their chins over this in the future. :)</p> 	"This edit would have to be a suggested edit." error is confusing and unclear<p>I tried to suggest an edit on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/18565352/254830">this question</a> to retag it.

These are what I call "fault" closes.</p>  <p>Questions that are closed as "duplicate" or "too localized" do NOT carry a downvote. They need to be closed for the sake of the site, but the questioner is not expected to know that, and the close is "no fault."</p>  <p>Right now, "not constructive" is considered a "no fault" close. But I can think of TWO versions of "not constructive," one of which would be a "fault" close, and one of which would be "no fault."</p>  <p>This would be the "fault" version, which I would describe as "subjective and argumentive":</p>  <p><strong>As written,</strong> this question will likely solicit debate, arguments, polling, or extended discussion, <strong>although it might be answerable in a different form.</strong></p>  <p>This would be the "no fault" version, which I would describe as "not constructive":</p>  <p>This question is not a good fit for the site. It will likely solicit debate, arguments, polling, or extended discussion <strong>because there is no known body of fact or literature on which to reasonably base an answer.</strong></p>  <p>The downvote for the "fault" version would reflect a belief that the question could be improved, and encourage the OP (or other editors) to do so.</p>  <p>With a "no fault" close, the question can't be improved BY DEFINITION. But it also reflects the fact that the OP did his "best," and that it is being closed because (like duplicates and localized questions) it is BAD FOR THE SITE as opposed to being "objectively" bad.</p>  <p>Should we separate "not constructive" closes into "fault" (subjectie and arugmentive") and "no fault" ("not constructive")versions as outlined above?</p> 
non-duplicate	Should I approve or reject a pending edit that duplicates another edit?<p>Imagine this scenario (this has happened to me, but I can't find any examples ATM):</p>  <p>I come across a post that needs editing, for whatever reason, and make necessary changes to it.  After submitting my edit, I notice that there is a pending edit that duplicates the changes that I just made (or makes some of the changes, but not others).</p>  <p>Should the pending edit be rejected?  I'm often hesitant to reject it because that will reflect negatively on the editor, even though its a perfectly valid edit that just happens to duplicate what I already did (or overwrite some of my changes, through no fault of the editor, since we submitted the edits at the same time.)</p> 	My answer got deleted, even though the OP said it was correct?<p>So,  I was answering some questions, and I came across this one <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/11565350/427309">here</a>.</p>  <p>My answer got deleted, even though mine was the one that the OP stated (in the chat transcripts) that it was correct. How should I go about this situation. I have already flagged the answer for moderator attention, but I fear that that will not get it undeleted.</p>  <p>To Be Clear:</p>  <p>It was deleted because @interjay had complained that I was leaving the answer because it was invalid, whereas, in fact, the OP had stated that it did work for him already (read the comments). Thus, my answer was correct, it just got a massive down vote wave because I made an error in my wording in the initial revision.</p> 
non-duplicate	Allow  "spam" and "doesn't belong here" flagging in the review queues<p>In the new review queues, we're given a number of options:</p>  <ul> <li>Close / Delete / Recommend Deletion</li> <li>Edit</li> <li>Do Not Close / Looks Good</li> <li>Not Sure</li> </ul>  <p>However, there's no option for when we find a post that's spam or offensive/gibberish/abusive.  </p>  <p>Looking around, I saw that <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/141145/149432">Shog9 addressed the lack of full flagging</a> in a question about the lack of voting:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The core philosophy here is that each queue focuses on a specific task or question, and provides the tools most important for resolving it. If you want to do something else, <strong>there will always be a prominent link to the full question page.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>I can see that for the "needs moderator attention" flag, but not for the ones resolvable by the community:</p>  <ul> <li>Close vote flags for those who can't yet vote to close</li> <li>Spam</li> <li>Doesn't belong here</li> </ul>  <p>I think these flags fit in with the core philosophy: community review, and resolution, of low quality posts or questions with close votes. 6 people flagging a post as "spam"/"doesn't belong here" to delete it doesn't seem to be functionally different than 5 people voting to close a question, or 3 people voting to delete an answer.</p>  <p>So, given that close vote and and low quality posts queues are where most of the posts falling into these categories are going to be, it seems like an oversight that we can't do this.</p> 	Does the [algorithm] tag serve a purpose?<p>Does the <a href="/questions/tagged/algorithm" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'algorithm'" rel="tag">algorithm</a> tag serve any purpose?

duplicate	How to vote on friends / colleagues ' questions (or answers)<p>Almost every time a colleague of mine asks a question, we have discussed this problem beforehand. Also, we sometimes meta-discuss the question for stackoverflow (why did I get the "this might be subjective" warning, is this understandable enough, etc). This is less so with answers, but I could believe for some groups this works the same. For now I'll stick to questions, but you could <code>s/question/answer</code> if you like.</p>  <p>The resulting question is almost always</p>  <ul> <li>Interesting for me, and a problem I don't know the answer to. <ul> <li>I probably would favorite it</li> </ul></li> <li>According to me a valid and good question (as we talked about it beforehand) <ul> <li>I would probably want to upvote it.</li> </ul></li> </ul>  <p>Now I believe to read that "ring voting" is a thing, and I tried to find some questions about this, but didn't find many. I did find and read this blogpost from 2008: <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/12/vote-fraud-and-you/">http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/12/vote-fraud-and-you/</a> . </p>  <p>It reads to me that upvoting 'fraud' is more commonplace then downvoting and it might seem anomylous that I would upvote almost all questions from one user. If all colleagues would do this to their team, you'd get some mediocre questions getting a lot of votes, and some users getting a lot of attention, points etc from that. If you would -as seems to be done -, sort the amount of upvotes for my colleague, you'd get me being 'anomalous' in front of the crowd.</p>  <p>On the other hand, as explained above, I do want to upvote almost all stuff some of my colleagues put on here for (I believe) the right reasons: they are questions I consider good and interesting. It's just that I know of all their questions (as they tell me about them), which obviously isn't the case for a random user. </p>  <p>So what is the deal?</p>  <ul> <li><strong>When is upvoting content from one user frowned upon?</strong></li> <li><strong>Would my usecase be in danger of being a (what I consider 'false') positive for the fraud-detection?</strong> (and would you agree with that or not)</li> <li><strong>How to prevent this false positive</strong> (if you agree with me it is one, otherwise this is a moot question) -<em>> As noted in the comments: I'm not looking for tricks, so an answer could be "don't vote for your colleagues". I agree that there should be no to 'tricks' around that could be used for real fraud of course</em></li> </ul> 	Is it considered appropriate to upvote my friend if I find their posts useful?<p>Say a specific user is my friend. Naturally, I follow the user's activity and each time he/she posts an answer, I upvote it. Of course I do that only after a careful read and if I find it useful, at least for the OP.</p>  <p>Is it considered inappropriate? Would some automatic algorithm track my upvoting activity and cancel it?</p>  <p>And what if that friend also gives me the same attention?</p>  <p>Again, I don't mean <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/tags/serial-voting/info">upvoting just because we're friends</a>. The relation just attracts attention to the user's activity which is followed by probable upvote (as that friend is by all means no less than the ultimate professional).</p> 
non-duplicate	Is it bad form to answer a jquery question with a plugin?<p>When a question is asked relating to to jQuery to begin with, is recommending an existing plugin that does exactly what the OP is trying to do appropriate? </p>  <p>Why re-invent the wheel for basic stuff?</p>  <p>To use an analogy -  If some one tells you they need something to beat nails into the wall. </p>  <p>Do you explain how to whittle a handle, forge a head, and put those things together to make a hammer?</p>  <p>OR</p>  <p>Do you just direct them to a toolbox and tell them to pick up a hammer?</p>  <p>And before the first response explains that in some cases you need a custom tool for a specific job, I'm not really speaking about those cases. I realize fully that plug-ins are not the cure all answer for everything.</p> 	What's the workflow for chat-suspended users to improve?<p>A user was on the receiving-end of a 30 minute chat suspension.  One of his messages was flagged, and as a mod, when I validated the flag, that auto-suspended them for 30 minutes.  After 30 minutes, he came back in, and clearly had no idea why he had been suspended.</p>  <ul> <li>They didn't know which message was flagged.</li> <li>They didn't know the reason the message was flagged.</li> </ul>  <p>To me, this seems like a terribly-designed system, but I wanted to make sure we weren't missing something.  Before a user is suspended on an SE site, they generally do something, get flagged, and the moderators suspend them.  When this happens, they send a message that explains to the user why they are suspended, and how to avoid future suspensions (i.e. improve their behavior).</p>  <p>After someone is chat-suspended, what are they supposed to do to find out why it happened, and what they can do to avoid future suspensions?  Are there some features in the chat system that we were both missing that lays out some of this information?</p> 
non-duplicate	Why is my account appearing on SO top users?<p>When I view the <a href="http://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/alltime/stackoverflow">top users page for SO</a>, my user account is right up top. However, I noticed that when I change the drop-down to select any other SE site, my account disappears from the list.</p>  <p>Here's a screenshot:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/R9F35.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>I think this seems a little odd. Is anyone else seeing their own account under SO top users?</p> 	Don't count spam and offensive flags that were removed when viewing a flagged post<p>I just encountered a post with 6 offensive flags while processing the queue:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DmfWc.png" alt=""></p>  <p><sup>(7 is the total number of flags including red flags; the 7th flag is a regular flag.)</sup></p>  <p>Normally, when a post accrues 6 red flags, the post is automatically deleted, but it never happened with this post. The only thing in its revision history is a single edit. That edit wasn't rolled back either. So why wasn't this post auto-deleted?</p>  <p>Apparently, the first 2 offensive flags were marked as disputed. I'm guessing this happened as a result of deleting them manually (instead of dismissing them as helpful or declined), which a moderator is able to do at any time. The next three were marked helpful a very short while later (?!) and there's a new one pending, making the total 6, leading me to writing this.</p>  <p>It's still quite unclear to me whether red flags that were dismissed as helpful (the three I mentioned) still count toward the auto-deletion threshold after being dismissed, but seeing how the post has a total of 6 offensive flags and is still not auto-deleted, it's more likely that the first two flags that were removed by hand were rendered ineffective in that process.</p>  <p>If that's the case, those flags should probably not count into the total number that's displayed in the queue and the mod overlay either.</p>

duplicate	Responding to your "too localized" concerns<p>As part of our <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/184154/closing-changes-on-hold-unclear-too-broad-opinion-based-off-topic-reasons">closing overhaul</a>, we've moved, reorganized, and renamed a number of close reasons, including too localized.  While that change was informed both by widespread misuse of the reason and <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/search?q=too+localized">numerous</a> <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/132319/consider-changing-the-wording-of-the-too-localized-close-reason">meta posts</a> from you, many of you have also indicated concerns about its new home in the off-topic menu.</p>  <p>And when you're concerned, we usually are, too.</p>  <p>So, we wanted to provide a little more background, and more importantly, set up a place where you can share any gaps you're finding once the changes roll out network wide.</p>  <h2>tl;dr:</h2>  <ul> <li>If you find examples that TL used to cover, but that can't be addressed by the new "off-topic" reasons, post them as answers here.</li> <li>If you want more background on why <em>something</em> needed to be changed, read the large number of words below.</li> </ul>  <h2>Did TL clear out many bad questions?</h2>  <p>Sort of.  It definitely helped us eliminate <em>some</em> bad questions, and we need to make sure we deal with those, but it was the least frequently used close reason - a recent sample found it used on roughly 1.3% of total questions asked on Stack Overflow (with similar network stats). But reviews of sampled questions by mods and staff found that roughly <em>half</em> of TL closures probably should not have been closed, meaning:</p>  <ul> <li>its <em>correct</em> use was affecting roughly 0.65% of questions (for perspective, all closed questions were about 12% of those asked) </li> <li>in its current form, it seemed to be causing as much harm as good</li> <li>on average, you'd have to read just over 150 questions before you encountered  a single one of these.</li> </ul>  <p>That's <em>not</em> to say that we should ignore those questions or don't care about closing them, just that the total volume they represent, while not trivial, also... ain't overwhelming. But the real issue is that it wasn't working consistently:</p>  <h2>What was wrong?</h2>  <p>The two main problems with the old reason were:</p>  <ul> <li>no one really agreed on what it meant, and </li> <li>it attracted false positives from trigger-words (locations, etc.). </li> </ul>  <p>Its description had three parts, and the first two parts were very broken:</p>  <ul> <li><p><strong>only relevant to a small geographic area</strong> - there are extremely few questions that need to be closed due to locational constraints that <em>aren't closable for other reasons,</em> and no one ever agreed on what "small" meant, or <a href="http://meta.programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/1057/too-localized-by-population-size-instead-of-geographical-area">even what units to use</a>. This was a distraction from the real need.</p></li> <li><p><strong>limited to a specific moment in time</strong> - again, there was no even semi-consistent standard.  Some people felt that meant days, others months, etc.  Some sites applied it to any beta, which seems reasonable, until you remember that gmail was in beta for five <em>years</em>.  Questions that <em>are</em> obsolete definitely need to be addressed, but <em>most</em> technical questions will eventually suffer that fate, so making everyone pick their own definition of how short is too short before that happens wasn't working.</p></li> </ul>  <p>The third part was more generalized:</p>  <ul> <li><strong>unlikely to help any future visitors… or an extraordinarily narrow situation not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet</strong> This is starting to get to the heart of why TL <em>was</em> important. Now, the old wording did invite debate over when to use it - the first clause seems to require just that one person other than you could benefit (2 people total), while the second one suggests that some meaningful percentage of all internet users should.  (As of today, 1% of all internet users would be 24MM people).</li> </ul>  <p>But setting aside the  lack of a clear line, isn't that <em>concept</em>  useful?  It is. The core of it sounds like the generalized "too narrow," which some have suggested should be a network-wide reason like "too broad".  </p>  <p>But "too broad" has a line we're comfortable with: "Answerable in several paragraphs."  There's still <em>some</em> room for interpretation, but we're all on the same planet.  </p>  <p>But, while we do really like the <em>idea</em> of "too narrow," because it speaks to our belief that the best questions are those that benefit more people: </p>  <p><strong>"Too narrow," is very, very hard to establish even a rough guideline for.</strong></p>  <p>Which is why our top users are still interpreting it wildly differently, even within individual sites.</p>  <h2>How do we retain all the good stuff</h2>  <p><strong>Too Localized <em>was</em> doing something important.</strong> It was being used, quite helpfully, to allow sites to cull the specific types of one-off questions that their experts didn't want. The most common of these, by far, was</p>  <ul> <li><strong>"code dump"/"find my typo"</strong> questions on Stack Overflow -  where the author provides a huge block of code, or a broken site's url, with little more than, "Why not working?"</li> </ul>  <p>They <em>should be</em> closed. But it's actually a lot <em>easier</em> to close them as a specific off-topic reason, because it eliminates all those silly debates about whether someone else might make the same typo, or how many helpees are required.  Instead, we say, "our definition of our topic has explicitly excluded that".  We're not debating anything, our store simply doesn't sell that thing:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>We've refined our definition of what's on-topic here.  The "headline" may be 'programming', but what we mean is:</strong>  </p>      <ul>   <li>Programming, but <strong>not</strong> Code dumps.  </li>   <li>Programming, but <strong>not</strong> whiteboard problems.  </li>   <li>Programming tools, <strong>yes</strong>.  </li>   <li>Programming snacks, <strong>no</strong>.</li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>It's really not all that different than the way other sites, over time, identified the specific question types they don't want, and made them off-topic:</p>  <blockquote>   <ul>   <li>Gaming, but <strong>not</strong> "name that game"</li>   <li>photography, but <strong>not</strong> "fix this picture"</li>   <li>cooking recipe <em>replacements</em>, <strong>yes</strong></li>   <li>cooking recipe <em>requests</em>, <strong>no</strong></li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>Most of those <em>could</em> fall under Too Localized, but it actually makes more sense to make them part of the definition of the topic, because it makes their closure less subject to interpretation.</p>  <h2>What now? Post any gaps as answers here.</h2>  <p>We hope the above helps make some of you less worried, as we do think this will actually work <em>better</em> for the key good uses of TL.</p>  <p>But we're still a little worried about gaps. </p>  <p><strong>If you find a question that previously fell under TL, but for some reason can't easily be dealt with through off-topic, post it as an answer here, so we can follow up and adjust as needed.</strong></p>  <p>For sites other than SO, you may want to discuss it on your local meta first, to get community consensus, but that's up to you.</p> 	Which close reason should I use to close "typo" questions now?<p>A while back I posted my opinion that <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/167342/close-all-the-typo-questions">"typo" related questions should be closed and removed</a>, which had a lot of support so I'm going on the assumption that it's still generally correct.</p>  <p>For example this question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18179485/link-to-css-not-working">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18179485/link-to-css-not-working</a></p>  <p>Solved by changing <code>boostrap.css</code> to <code>bootstrap.css</code>. "Boostrap" of course being a mere typo. Useful to no one but the OP.</p>  <p>I miss "too localized" because it was perfect for typos, but I accept that it is gone. </p>  <p>Under the current system, which close reason (if any) apply to this and other such questions? Am I supposed to type in a custom reason?</p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18179485/link-to-css-not-working#comment26636774_18179485">I tried a custom message</a>, does this seem reasonable, or confusing?</p>  <blockquote>   <p>This question appears to be off-topic because it is... A typo.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Is there something else that would make more sense? </p>

duplicate	Opinions on closing an older question as a duplicate of a newer question<p>What's everyone's opinion on closing an older question as a duplicate of a newer one, if the newer one is clearly the better resource?

Is it considered good practice to close the older as a duplicate of the newer?</p>  <p>More generally, is it ok to do that for separate questions posted by different people, if the older question went unanswered but the newer has a good answer?</p>  <p>(I should probably mention I saw <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/15381/double-posts-close-the-older-or-newer-one">this question</a>, but I think this is separate)</p> 	Is it OK to retrospectively close as a duplicate?<p>Suppose a question is asked, answered and accepted, then at some later date another duplicate question is asked, also answered and accepted, but no one picks up the duplication.</p>  <p>If the second question/answer is "better" (more votes for both question and answer), is it OK to close the first question as a duplicate, even though at the time it was posed it was a new question?</p>  <p>It seems OK to me, but there may be some etiquette aspect I'm not considering.</p>

Does anybody know of any mechanism to do this?</p> 	I can't (vote to) close a question I voted to close before but then retracted?<p>For example...</p>  <p>I closed a vote for 'too broad'.

non-duplicate	Blue Background of Current Community region<p>The new region <strong>Current Community</strong> in the Top-Bar has a light blue background that is not fully stretched or the background should be the same as on the other regions.</p>  <p>Currently it looks a little misaligned.</p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xpLb3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xpLb3.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p> 	Inline code markdown is handled differently in questions/answers and comments<p>In questions/answers, to put backticks within my inline code I have to enclose the whole thing in double backticks.</p>  <pre> ``cd `brew --prefix` `` </pre>  <p>In comments I can escape backticks with backslashes.

non-duplicate	Word-wrap unhelpful when reviewing code-block edits<p>The lack of horizontal scrolling in side-by-side diffs of code-blocks during the review process often makes the process somewhat challenging.  Here is an example that prompted me to finally speak up about this.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GxwLv.png" alt="Word-wrapped diff of code block"></p>  <p>Now, I expect that horizontal scrolling has probably been disabled so that the reviewer doesn't miss important changes, but I believe this does more harm than good.  Sure, I can see all the changes side-by-side, but it's not at all easy to see whether the edit is an improvement.</p>  <p>In fact, the edit on the above question was approved (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/2653320">by a single user</a>).  If you <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/posts/18048311/revisions">look at the revision stack for the question</a> it's still not clear whether the edit was an improvement.</p>  <p>In normal display of a question or answer, horizontal scrolling in code-blocks is enabled.  If I want to examine the layout before and after, I need to drill into the revision stack and edit individual revisions in order to see a preview.  Because I can no longer see the actual changes as a diff, the whole review process is undermined.</p>  <p>May I recommend that horizontal scrollbars can be enabled on code-block reviews?  Even better would be a check-box that allows me to toggle horizontal scrolling and/or enable preview without diff.</p>  <p>Note that, by the time I finished writing this question, Meta had finally provided a <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/148584/200806">similar question</a> in the sidebar, but it appears to have had little attention.  So please accept this more fully-formed question as a follow-up.</p> 	Merge [using] into [using-statement] or vice versa?<p>Both have absolutely similar wiki entries:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>In the C# language, the using keyword is employed in two different contexts, as a Directive and a Statement.</p> </blockquote>  <p>and</p>  <blockquote>   <p>It takes an expression that evaluates to an IDisposable. After that it executes an associated code block. Once the code block exits(both with normal and exceptional exits) it disposes the result of the original expression.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I think existence of both, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/using" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'using'" rel="tag">using</a> (463) and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/using-statement" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'using-statement'" rel="tag">using-statement</a> (184), makes no sense.</p>

Whenever I ask a question about a programming language that I'm relatively unfamiliar with, it often brings me a lot of ridicule from the rest of the community (which may be well-deserved, since the amount of ignorance that I have shown may in fact be unacceptable).</p>  <p>Should I stop asking questions about programming languages that I am unfamiliar with, and focus on just one programming language instead? I feel quite discouraged by all of the downvotes that I've gotten as a result of my lack of expertise in certain subjects.</p>  <p>One recurring pattern that I've noticed is that questions are often downvoted if they demonstrate relative unfamiliarity with a particular subject. I'm reasonably familiar with the JavaScript and Java programming languages, but I'm relatively unfamiliar with Bash, Lua, Python, Haxe, and C# - therefore, my relative unfamiliarity with these subjects will tarnish my reputation, since everyone expects me to be well-informed about every subject that I have ever discussed here. If one of my questions is downvoted, I usually take it as an indication that the rest of the community is appalled by my apparent ignorance of a particular subject, and deems me to be worthy of ridicule. Perhaps I'm being overly-sensitive, but I find all of these negative reviews to be quite upsetting.</p>  <p>Now I'm faced with a dilemma: Should I stop asking questions about subjects that I'm relatively unfamilar with (in order to avoid being downvoted), and only discuss topics that I am  familiar with, or should I leave Stack Overflow entirely, assuming that my contributions have been mostly unconstructive and harmful?</p>

I'm in the habit of commenting immediately after I close, so I can see this happening a lot.  Even for mods who normally comment before closing, the rare occurrence of this flag when they forget or whatever should be dismissed on a comment just like deleting a post clears flags.</p>  <p>I also disagree with the general premise that mods should be nagged instead of being taught up front what to do when closing, but that's a subject for a different post.  There's also the occasional question which is about apples or something, and it's not exactly necessary to leave a comment when closing as off-topic.</p> 	Dismiss the "closed without comment" flag automatically once a comment is posted<p>On beta sites, when a question is closed and there is no comment at all on it, an automatic flag is raised. The idea is that each closure should be explained, as a beta site is still defining the scope. </p>  <p>The part that makes this flag annoying is that it does not get dismissed automatically once a comment is posted. I have to manually dismiss it if I close first and comment later, which I usually do. Of course I could reverse the order, but there is still another case where it fails now. </p>  <p>If I choose to close using a custom reason, a comment gets added explaining the closure. But the automatic flag urging me to comment still gets raised. </p>  <p>I think the cleanest way to solve both issues would be to have any new comment on that question trigger the dismissal of the flag.</p>

Why should I be locked out from reviews for a week for trying to improve something? Although I know in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/2773481">my failed audit</a> that the edit was not salvageable, some original posts need editing, which I would do, unchecking the "helpful" box.</p>  <p>When you are presented with an edited post audit and you click "Reject," you must give a reason before you pass/fail. Why should this be any different?</p> 	"Improve" treated as improper response to proper response to audit<p>For the first time I failed an audit in review, but I sure don't think I should have.</p>  <p>I saw the edit wasn't that good, so I hit the improve button to clean things up and got this message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>This was an audit, designed to see if you were paying attention. You didn't pass. This edit vandalizes the post. Don't improve it – Reject it</p> </blockquote>  <p>Sure, I could have rejected it, but some of those can just be improved, especially if the original post needed editing.</p>  <p>Maybe <em>SO could keep track of my successful improves and see that I know what I'm doing, and let me hit the improve button and not fail me for the audit</em>.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>  <p>I realized after it happened to me again today, that my workflow is to see that there is an error, and instead of checking the whole post, I go into edit mode, and then completely go over the post editing it as needed.  Since SO doesn't seem to want to adapt to that kind of workflow, I'll unfortunately have to change mine, or just do less.  It really slows things down to have to completely go over a post twice (kind of like the inbox zero concept, try to deal with things immediately).</p>

I can understand limiting anons, as this would be too much to monitor, but I feel like registered users should be more trusted, especially if they have accounts on other stack exchanges.</p>  <p>The question: Should we trust users who have rep on other SE sites with more posting abilities?</p> 	How can I post an answer with many links, or earn that privilege without being allowed to post such quality answers?<p>I cannot submit my answer to  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/424752/">Any good graphing packages for Android?</a></p>  <p>I am aware that my reputation is low.

The original code provides no context, nor does it even compile, and the author admits himself that it's untested and theoretical.</p>  <p>From <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/editing">SO Editing Page</a> it reads to me like I'm doing the right thing, but now I'm wondering if there are some unwritten rules about editing that I haven't picked up on yet. </p> 	How far can I refactor the code in someone else's question?<p>With a growing number of more or less inexperienced programmers on Stack Overflow, it is frequent to see the questions containing code not only badly formatted, but also badly written. While editing a question to fix the formatting is okay, I'm wondering if it is correct, when editing a question, to bring small changes to the code to make it more readable. In other words, <strong>until when is it acceptable to do a modification of a piece of code in a question?</strong></p>  <h2>Example</h2>  <p>Let's say there is a question with following crappy C# source code:</p>  <pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"><code>void DoStuff( string filename ) {           String MsgToDisplay = "";            Stream stFile = new FileStream(filename);           if (stFile.Length &gt; 0)           {                Boolean result=this.validateFile( stFile );                if (result==true)                    MsgToDisplay="your file was submitted";                else                   MsgToDisplay="the file is invalid!";            }            return MsgToDisplay;        } </code></pre>  <p><strong>State 1:</strong> The first thing to do is a general cleanup just to make it readable:</p>  <pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"><code>void DoStuff(string filename) {     String MsgToDisplay = "";     Stream stFile = new FileStream(filename);     if (stFile.Length &gt; 0)     {         Boolean result = this.validateFile(stFile);         if (result == true)         {             MsgToDisplay = "your file was submitted";         }         else         {             MsgToDisplay = "the file is invalid!";         }     }      return MsgToDisplay; } </code></pre>  <p><strong>State 2:</strong> The next thing may be to make some changes according to the style guidelines for C# and other minor changes which does not affect the code: proper case, <code>bool</code> instead of <code>Boolean</code>, etc. The original author can still recognize her own code and if she understands well the code she's written, she will understand the new one.</p>  <pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"><code>private string DoStuff(string fileName) {     string messageToDisplay = string.Empty;     Stream stream = new FileStream(fileName);     if (stream.Length &gt; 0)     {         bool result = this.ValidateFile(stFile);         if (result)         {             messageToDisplay = "Your file was submitted.";         }         else         {             messageToDisplay = "The file is invalid.";         }     }      return messageToDisplay; } </code></pre>  <p><strong>State 3:</strong> The last thing to do: make the more substantial changes by bringing things the original author may not know if she's a beginner:</p>  <pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"><code>private string DoStuff(string fileName) {     string messageToDisplay = string.Empty;     bool? isFileValid = null;     using (Stream stream = new FileStream(fileName))     {         if (stream.Length &gt; 0)         {             isFileValid = this.ValidateFile(stFile);         }     }      if (isFileValid.HasValue)     {         messageToDisplay = isFileValid.Value ? "Your file was submitted." : "The file is invalid.";     }      return messageToDisplay; } </code></pre>  <h2>My thoughts</h2>  <p>Until now, I thought it may be a good idea to go until the state 2, but never do the state 3. If we do the first two states:</p>  <ul> <li>It leverages the quality of the content of Stack Overflow in general and shows that this is not a sort of Q&amp;A website where you can post questions without bothering to format them correctly</li> <li>When other beginners are reading well-formatted code, they will probably try to write well-formatted code outside Stack Overflow too</li> <li>The original author will see that her code was reformatted and maybe make an effort later to format the code by her own. She can also wonder herself why <code>String</code> was transformed into <code>string</code>, why there is a <code>if (result)</code> instead of <code>if (result == true)</code>, etc</li> </ul>  <p>I had a lot of pain to go to the state 3, because:</p>  <ul> <li>It changes code so much that the original author may not understand why her own code was replaced by some stuff she doesn't even understand.</li> <li>The modified code may be quoted in the answers. When the original author will try to link the answers to her own, original piece of code, she may not understand an answer, and will blame the answerer, instead of me (or the person who modified the question).</li> <li>There is a risk of changing the original algorithm, just by mistake.</li> </ul>  <p>On the other hand,</p>  <ul> <li>I see a lot of answers which start by enumerating the incorrect parts of the source code: forgotten <code>using</code>s on <code>IDisposable</code> objects, possible SQL Injection, etc. I don't think those things have their place in the answers.</li> <li>Again, keeping questions containing code with SQL Injection and without appropriate <code>using</code>s reduce the quality of Stack Overflow content. It is especially important since many beginners copy-paste code from Stack Overflow questions/answers without understanding it, nor reading the whole page with all the answers and comments.</li> </ul>

I made a determination on one edit, and the next appeared. I immediately thought "wait--I wonder" and clicked my browser's back button to check something else regarding that review. I honestly don't remember what it was, but everything turned out fine. So I clicked the forward button on my browser to get back to the next suggested edit in line. And I got this:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TkirZ.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>This suggested edit is pretty clearly a review audit, and if you'll glance at the text inside the shiny red circle, you'll see that reloading the audit in the browser window generates the error:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>This item is not reviewable.</p> </blockquote>  <p>When I proceeded onward to the next edit, I was not given another audit. Edits proceeded as normal.</p>  <p>The problem I see here is that it gives robo-reviewers a way to cheat the audit system. It would take them a little extra time, but it would be a 100% guarantee that they would never fail an audit. It's easy: load next review, click backspace key, load review again. If you see the error, hit next and repeat. If you don't, press approve and repeat.</p>  <p>So... Fix? :)</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong>: </p>  <p>Huh... Further interesting is this.

If we decide to improve the edit, then we know we are improving it because we clicked on the improve button.  However, if you are currently editing a post and someone sneaks in a suggestion before you're finished, there is no such indication that we improved an edit.  It goes through as if it was an improvement.  <em>But I was not improving some edit suggestion.</em></p>  <p>I've run into this so many times where I was making a major edit and someone manages to submit a suggestion that tweaks a thing or two in the post.  If I saw such an edit, I would have <em>rejected</em> it on sight.  But since I get no notification if a suggested edit is submitted, there's no way I would have known about it unless I happen to have the question open in another tab and constantly check it for updates (I do this but it's annoying to <em>have</em> to do it).  I don't want to be rewarding these useless suggestions.</p>  <p><strong>I propose that if an edit or suggestion is made some time between the time I start my edit and when I attempt to submit it, the system should stop me to notify that an edit or suggestion was made and perhaps display it for me.</strong></p>  <p>I imagine that implementation could be as simple as locally storing the current revision at the start and checking the revision at the time of submission and see if they agree.  The notification could appear very much like the edit suggestion dialog appears.  It could show my edit compared to the revision since I last saw the post and the latest revision or suggestion (or some combination).</p>  <p>This would also be a perfect opportunity to see if merging my edit and the previous edit is possible.  It also gives me a chance to decide if I really want to go through with my submission or step back and not submit since I can see that there's a more superior edit.  Making conflicting edits could be less likely and easier to deal with.  I think that's a win-win situation.</p>  <p>I think this would be a nice complement what's currently in place (checking for edits that has been submitted periodically).  It doesn't always work for regular edits and it does not include updates about edit suggestions.  All I really care about here is merely <em>knowing</em> that an edit (suggestion) was made some time between the time I started editing and when I submitted the edit.</p>  <p>I have yet to see this myself but there supposedly are notifications if you make an edit but it isn't considered more substantial than the previous revision.  I don't think that's enough.  It really should display the dialog/notification/whatever if you are editing over <em>any</em> revision, substantial or not.</p> 	I have passed daily cap.

duplicate	Should we change vague question titles to more descriptive titles?<p>Sometimes, I encounter questions with vague titles: they do not always specify what is really being asked.</p>  <p>For example, there is a question called <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/801095/how-do-i-find-all-the-files-that-were-create-only-today">How do I find all the files that were create only today</a> which is asking only about files on Linux/Unix. This is clearly a useful question, but I think "How do I find all the files that were created today in Unix/Linux?" would be a more descriptive title.</p>  <p>In a situation such as this one, should I change the title to describe a question's topic more accurately, or should I leave the question's title as-is?</p> 	Titles should be stand-alone summaries of questions *without* depending on tags<p><strong>Titles should be completely independent of tags.

Linking to these articles would be much more convenient (and I'd be able to fit more content into a comment) if there was a shorthand for Wikipedia links. The current syntax means I'm taking up 30 character plus the length of the article name: <code>[](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/)</code>.</p>  <p>Usually the words I'd like to become a link also happen to be the article name.  It would be extremely convenient if I could take advantage of this fact and make those words a link simply by enclosing them in <code>[w:</code> and <code>]</code> (or something similar).</p>  <p>So when I want to link someone to the article on Stack Overflow, currently I have to do:</p>  <pre><code>[Stack Overflow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow) </code></pre>  <p>Under this proposed feature that could be shortened to:</p>  <pre><code>[w:Stack Overflow] </code></pre>  <p>I fully admit this shortcut is most useful in comments, but very much so when I'm trying to link to multiple articles, and help people in their understanding of various topics.

When I read the question I cannot truly understand the question until I have read all of the edits as well.</p>  <p>The whole point of being able to edit is to modify the text, not only append to it</p>  <p>The word "hello" is removed automatically from the start of questions.  </p>  <h2>Can "Edit" be similarly "errorized"?</h2>  <p>It could be highlighted when using "Edit" that new information can be merged with the existing text instead.</p>  <p>It might take longer to edit, but hopefully this would make the question easier to read and improve the quality of questions.</p>

duplicate	How do I get attention for old, unanswered questions?<p>I asked a question almost as soon as I get my account.  I got a few decent answers, but I didn't get the information I wanted.  The question has long since become buried by newer questions, and there's still no accepted answer.  Unfortunately, because there are six answers, it probably looks to a casual observer like the question was answered and I just neglected to mark any answer as accepted.</p>  <p>So what's the protocol for me to try to get this question answered?  I see several options:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Post the question a second time, possibly linking to the original, to get it back onto the new page.  This is encouraged on sites like Reddit.  However, it's probably not appropriate here, since we're encouraged to check for dupes and not submit a question that's already been asked by someone else, so this probably falls under that heading.</p></li> <li><p>Wait for some kind of wiki-like talk page to be implemented, then post a plea on the talk page for input and hope that activity on the talk page bumps up the question.</p></li> <li><p>Do nothing further on the Stack Overflow website.  If I edit my post to say that I haven't accepted any of the current answers but are looking for more, then the question might get answered eventually by people browsing through old questions to find something they can answer.</p></li> <li><p>Post the question on other sites, but link to my original question on Stack Overflow.  People will either answer here, or they'll answer on the other site and I can post the accepted answer here myself.

duplicate	Ability to alter my favorite sites in the Android app<p>So I finally got my invitation (yay! It's awesome! Thanks!) and I'd like this first feature request to be typed from here. </p>  <p>I propose the ability to change the "favorite" sites, and also include meta sites in there. </p>  <p>Right now, I presume it's reading the list of sites ordered by reputation.  I propose the following: </p>  <ul> <li>If I am a moderator on any site, those sites and their metas should come first.</li> <li>After that, ordered by reputation. </li> <li>The above is only the default order, and can be altered freely by the user.</li> </ul> 	Add sites to the sidebar favorite section<p>For now I see only the sites I already have some rep on, in the sidebar favorite section. But I want to add more site to it so that I can visit them easily without going to All sites > search. </p>  <p>On desktop I can just type a url and jump sites, it's not that easy on mobile. On mobile devices there should be an option where one can favorite sites. or else I'd have to search for the site every single time. It's not a browser so there is no tab either for quick access. Even a "last visited sites" section would do it.</p>  <p>TBH, that "favorite sites" section has different meaning for users with high and low reps. For users with higher reps, that section is more usable because they have already matured enough in a site to call it favorite. For users like me with lowers reps, it's hard to call them favorite. And the app is for everyone. Hence my suggestion.</p>  <p>Anything planned for this? </p>

If you're already intimately familiar with the phenomenon, please skip past the first set of bullet points to where I ask for recommendations.)</p>  <hr>  <p>I think many of us have experienced this on occasion:</p>  <ol> <li><p>You open up a narrow-looking question, usually dealing with some specific error message.  The question probably contains a snippet of <em>sloppy</em> but not quite <em>awful</em> code; code indicating that the author, typically a new/low-rep user, possibly a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2004/03/02/82840.aspx" rel="nofollow">Mort</a>, doesn't really know what he's doing.  I'm not trying to be condescending here, he's probably very intelligent and hardworking, but in this <em>specific</em> case, he's clearly in way over his head.</p></li> <li><p><em>However</em>, as a <em>question</em>, it's not really too bad.  The goal and problem are both clearly stated.  The code is formatted (sort of).  Mort was polite and checked his spelling.  The question looks <em>answerable</em>, although from a rep perspective<sup>*</sup> it's an obvious dead-end, it's had maybe 3 views in the past 30 minutes.</p></li> <li><p>So you decide, <em>you know what, this person took the time to write up the question properly, he deserves an answer</em>, put on your good citizen hat and throw him a bone.  You slog through the ugly code, find the offending line, direct his attention to it and explain why it's wrong and how it needs to be fixed.</p></li> <li><p>Later, he leaves a comment saying that yes, that was indeed the problem and your answer helped him fix it <em>(great!)</em>.  Oh, but, now there's another problem <em>(uh-oh...)</em>. Something else is broken.  After letting out a long sigh, you read the comment and/or edited question, roll up your sleeves, and write up Take 2, hoping that's the end of it.</p></li> <li><p>And of <em>course</em> it's not the end.  Now maybe the error is gone, but it's not doing what it's supposed to.  If you're anything like me, your patience is now starting to wear thin. It's lousy code and you didn't volunteer to help him rewrite his whole app.  And of course, the question still only has 12 views, and nobody has upvoted either the question or your answer, <em>including the person you're helping</em>, so this is turning out to be a genuinely thankless task in all respects.  Welcome to "Family Tech Support", Web 2.0 Edition.</p></li> </ol>  <p><sub>* Which is of course just an arbitrary number that none of us care about. Not <em>really</em>, anyway. Not very <em>much</em>, at least.</sub></p>  <hr>  <p>So, here's where I get to <strong>my</strong> question.  At this point, do you:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Leave a comment, stating as politely as possible that you've done your best to help him answer the original question he asked, and if he has a new problem then he should start a new question?  <em>(I did this once, and actually ended up with an accept, but I felt kind of guilty afterwards, I don't think anybody answered his 2nd question).</em></p></li> <li><p>Bite the bullet and edit your answer a 3rd, 4th, 5th time, however many times it takes to resolve his issue, knowing full well that he may not even remember to accept the answer once you're done? <em>(I may work for free on SO, but that doesn't mean my time is worthless.)</em></p></li> <li><p>Just abandon the question, hoping that it will force Mort to start thinking for himself?</p></li> <li><p>Something else?</p></li> </ul>  <p>I've tried all three of the above and none of them ever quite feel right. I do want to help, but at the same time there are a lot more "lucrative" questions I could be answering. And I don't mind spending a lot of time on an answer either, <em>if</em> the question is interesting or important to me, but debugging is dull work.</p>  <p>I'd prefer not to reference specific questions here; I'm pretty sure that this is a shared experience, and my objective isn't to point fingers at "misbehaving" members.

Now you know."</li> <li>Say, "Hey, -1 because you said that."</li> <li>Say, "Hey, that what you said is actually the other, -1"</li> </ul>  <p>It's not that funny to offer free consultation letting ghosts assess your knowledge. I'm doing this for free so I expect this to be a fair trade by receiving <strong>real</strong> feedback for free. I'm also convinced I'm not the only one having this problem, so please share your opinions.</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong><br> I'm a little bit shocked. Within a minute after posting this "question" some people downvoted <em>almost all</em> of my questions (no subjective questions and I may say pretty hard to answer). So, some people are very touchy today although I didn't point the finger at anyone... I wouldn't have believed this could happen.</p> 	Should a person be allowed to contest downvotes on question or answers?<p>I have been feeling lately that there are a lot of trigger happy people on SO. Everyone is eager to click on the downvote button rather than leaving comments to improve QnA or justify their downvotes. I guess some people have taken this as a habit.</p>  <p>I am not sure but I wonder if it would be better to make it mandatory for members to leave a comment for downvotes. In that case, if the reason for downvoting is also downvoted, the downvote by this individual should be lifted.</p>  <p>I am not sure how it works, but lately any question that I ask, everyone talks about providing a working example and are ready to close vote or downvote the question, though I try to provide the context and a code snippet. I don't think this should be a criteria for downvoting. </p>  <p>I am just getting so frustrated people bringing down other people's reputation on SO for small issues which can be requested as clarification in comments section.</p>  <p>For e.g. if I am asking a question about a 3rd party control in used in Delphi, it is not possible for me to provide a working example for me as I am a .Net guy and I do not have a license for the TPA. </p>  <p>I might even get a downvote for asking this question. I am hesitant to ask questions now on SO.</p>  <p>Anyways, please explain your downvotes.</p> 
non-duplicate	Lift or reduce the comment rate-limiting timer for moderators<p>This is easily the most annoying timer on the site: post a second comment too quickly after the first, and the system kicks it back, telling you to wait 15 seconds. Count to 15 too quickly and retry, and it'll reset the timer... </p>  <p>Ok, I get it, we really shouldn't be posting comments that quickly. But for a moderator trying to respond to flags in a <a href="http://stackapps.com/questions/2116/pro-forma-comments">polite but expedient manner</a>, this is an unnecessary hassle. </p>  <h3>Suggestions</h3>  <ul> <li><p>Remove the comment rate-limiting entirely for moderators. If your moderator is posting trash comments, you probably have bigger problems.</p></li> <li><p>Restrict it to rate-limiting comments <em>on a single post</em>. That is, trying to rapid-fire comment on one answer fails, but posting one comment to one answer and another to another go through without a wait.</p></li> <li><p>Get rid of the infuriating timer reset. Ok, fine, gotta wait 15 seconds. It probably took me 14 seconds to get to this point anyway, so big deal. But come on, why do I have to stare at this infernal button for <em>another</em> 15 seconds?</p></li> </ul> 	Editing an answer created a new one<p>I was editing my answer here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/6765135/561731">issue with form method get on next page, would like for people to not see the initial page unless they hit the submit button</a></p>  <p>And when I clicked submit somehow it created a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6765135/issue-with-form-method-get-on-next-page-would-like-for-people-to-not-see-the-ini/6765232#6765232"><strong>new</strong> answer</a>, which I have since deleted, but you can see if you have eough rep.</p>  <p>Why did this happen?

These usually appear as an introductory-paragraph followed by a numbered list of questions.</p>  <ol> <li>Is this behavior really constructive?</li> <li>Isn't it better to open multiple questions in this case?</li> <li>Doesn't it go against the stackexchange concept of one-question-one-answer?</li> <li>Don't they discourage people from answering when they can say something interesting about one sub-questions but not about the others because their answer would be incomplete?</li> <li>Won't that mean that people won't answer at all?</li> <li>Or does it on the other hand cause people to write answers which only address one of the points of the question while ignoring others, hoping that others will provide answers for other points?</li> <li>When that happens, which answer should be accepted?</li> <li>When I consider them bad, should I close them as too broad or some other close-reason?</li> <li>Should I downvote them?</li> <li>Should I ask these people in a comment to split the question into multiple ones?</li> <li>Would there be a way to discourage people from opening such questions? </li> </ol>  <p>And then they usually end with a paragraph asking the audience to answer all of these questions at once. What do you think about them?</p>

People can answer the question on both sites, which means they have the same user base. Why would you try to split the community? They should all be one site because we have a common interest in helping people with code/programming. Why can't there be a <code>codereview</code> tag, instead of an entire new site, which splits the community. </p> 	Why in the footer some sites have first level domain (.com) and others do not?<p>Such as stackoverflow.com, serverfault.com, superuser.com.</p>  <p>I can see that those sites have their own domain names, so my guess that's the reason.

duplicate	Auto-delete/destroy 1 rep user when their post is deleted as spam<p>My common workflow when I see a blatant spam post by a 1 rep user is:</p>  <ol> <li>flag as spam (when I'm a mod this auto-deletes)</li> <li>go to user profile</li> <li>As a mod, I destroy the user. As a regular user I spam flag the other spam posts linked from the profile</li> </ol>  <p>These are a bit more clicks than absolutely necessary. While it is not terribly important to optimize this, it would be nice if we could perform these steps with even less effort.</p>  <p>My main assumption is that a 1 rep user that has one of their posts flagged as spam until deletion is almost certainly a pure spammer. I might be wrong there, but I've never seen an example that violates this rule.</p>  <p>Having to go to the profile is an unnecessary step, but I always do that to determine if the user has created more spam posts. Destroying is also not necessary, but it is quicker if the user has multiple posts, and if I have to go to the profile anyway it's also only a few clicks away.</p>  <p>To make this quicker, I suggest that users that have never earned <em>any</em> reputation and that have all their posts deleted by spam flags should be auto-destroyed. Destroying accounts doesn't really slow down spammers much or at all, but it is somewhat tidier and many mods do it anyway, even for single post spammers. It would also serve as feedback that this user can't possibly have more spam posts, preventing other users from checking the user's profile without need.</p>  <p>When I spam flag a post from a 1 rep user as a mod, I'd like to get immediate feedback on how many other posts the user has, and maybe even a quick way to directly preview those posts and destroy the account.</p>  <p>This would of course not happen for posts from real, active users due to the 1 rep limitations. Excessive self-promotion and other borderline spam issues are usually not dealt with by account destruction. This restriction also severely reduces the potential for abuse of this feature.</p>  <p>As for leaving accounts alive to gather information about spam URLs and/or IPs, this is something that should happen behind the scenes anyway that that we mods should not have to think about. The community and mods provide enough information by spam flagging, it would just have to be collected and aggregated by SE internally (and maybe this already happens).</p> 	Dealing with SPAM: 6 (or more?) spam flags should destroy the user instead of the -100 penalty<p>Before you downvote, I don't propose that any user that gets spam flagged would be instantly destroyed. Read on.</p>  <p>In the recent spam wave, I've noticed how the flagging system works. People very quickly reach the magic 6 spam flag count, and the post gets annihilated. That's good.</p>  <p>However, there are problems with that:</p>  <ul> <li>These spam flags get cleared from the queue. So mods won't see them nor be able to destroy the user effectively, without some sort of pointer, or manual lookup at the recent flags.</li> <li>Spam flags induce a -100 reputation penalty, which is 100% useless since the user always have 1 reputation point, and will not get lower.</li> </ul>  <p>My suggestion is as follow, if ALL of the following are true:</p>  <ul> <li>The user only has one post.</li> <li>The user only has one reputation (meaning that his only post was never upvoted).</li> <li>The user's only post has reached 6 (or more?) spam flags</li> <li>The user registered less than a week ago.</li> </ul>  <p>If all of the above are correct, the user should be <strong>automatically destroyed</strong>. That's what us mods do, why not automate the process?</p>

You slog through the ugly code, find the offending line, direct his attention to it and explain why it's wrong and how it needs to be fixed.</p></li> <li><p>Later, he leaves a comment saying that yes, that was indeed the problem and your answer helped him fix it <em>(great!)</em>.  Oh, but, now there's another problem <em>(uh-oh...)</em>. Something else is broken.  After letting out a long sigh, you read the comment and/or edited question, roll up your sleeves, and write up Take 2, hoping that's the end of it.</p></li> <li><p>And of <em>course</em> it's not the end.  Now maybe the error is gone, but it's not doing what it's supposed to.  If you're anything like me, your patience is now starting to wear thin. It's lousy code and you didn't volunteer to help him rewrite his whole app.  And of course, the question still only has 12 views, and nobody has upvoted either the question or your answer, <em>including the person you're helping</em>, so this is turning out to be a genuinely thankless task in all respects.

Not very <em>much</em>, at least.</sub></p>  <hr>  <p>So, here's where I get to <strong>my</strong> question.  At this point, do you:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Leave a comment, stating as politely as possible that you've done your best to help him answer the original question he asked, and if he has a new problem then he should start a new question?  <em>(I did this once, and actually ended up with an accept, but I felt kind of guilty afterwards, I don't think anybody answered his 2nd question).</em></p></li> <li><p>Bite the bullet and edit your answer a 3rd, 4th, 5th time, however many times it takes to resolve his issue, knowing full well that he may not even remember to accept the answer once you're done? <em>(I may work for free on SO, but that doesn't mean my time is worthless.)</em></p></li> <li><p>Just abandon the question, hoping that it will force Mort to start thinking for himself?</p></li> <li><p>Something else?</p></li> </ul>  <p>I've tried all three of the above and none of them ever quite feel right. I do want to help, but at the same time there are a lot more "lucrative" questions I could be answering. And I don't mind spending a lot of time on an answer either, <em>if</em> the question is interesting or important to me, but debugging is dull work.</p>  <p>I'd prefer not to reference specific questions here; I'm pretty sure that this is a shared experience, and my objective isn't to point fingers at "misbehaving" members.  I'm more looking for some practical advice on how to dig myself out of these pits of despair.</p>  <p>Anybody have any other ideas?</p> 	OP getting me to do the work for them over time<p>I've answered this question for a new user that wasn't originally worded like a "do my work for me" type of question, but has since turned that way through discussion in the comments. </p>  <p>They have posted a link to their code and asked how they should tweak it, to which I responded with help.</p>  <p>Then they responded with something to the effect of "We're almost there. Just a few more tweaks. Try doing it with something like..."</p>  <p>They're very clearly trying to drag the complete solution out of me. How should I go about dealing with this OP?</p>

Should such replies be encouraged as actually answering the question? Personally I feel this would be more suitable as a comment on the question instead.</p>  <p>Another issue is that the later upvoters probably ignored or never read the asker's comment, but that's another discussion on whether useful info can be left in comments or not :)</p>  <hr>  <p>2 mins after posting, I saw <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/8891/166736">Is &quot;Don&#39;t do it&quot; a valid answer?</a> in the sidebar.

non-duplicate	Close reason / procedure for "LMGTFY" questions<p>Some questions on Stack Overflow could be answered with a <em>minimal</em> amount of leg-work and research by the poster. The questions are either trivial, such as "How do I print a number as hex instead of decimal?" or are extensively covered by tutorials and articles both on Stack Overflow and the web at large ("How do I write a simple template in C++?"), or both.</p>  <p>As we all know, <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/15650/ban-lmgtfy-let-me-google-that-for-you-links">LMGTFY answers are banned</a> on Stack Exchange. There are some very good reasons for that which are well-covered in the discussions here on Meta.</p>  <p>Many of these questions, despite being so easy that the poster should have found the answers with 5 seconds of searching, do have good answers here, and recurring questions can easily be marked as duplicates. This seems perfectly appropriate where possible. The more general questions ("How do I learn C?") can be closed as Too Broad.</p>  <p>But I feel like there is a gap between "Duplicate" and "Too Broad" that is not covered by any existing close reason. Sometimes the question is specific, extensively covered by outside material, and yet not covered on Stack Overflow. I really miss the old "<a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/211080/improving-demonstrate-a-minimal-understanding-close-reason">demonstrate a minimal understanding</a>" close reason, which partially covered this gap.</p>  <p>Now that it's gone, though, what should we do with questions like this? Questions where there's no exact match on SO, but where you can find an answer yourself in 5 seconds by searching Google?</p>  <p>If the question doesn't have an exact match, should we just answer it anyway -- in the spirit of "building a knowledge base" -- even if that basically means quoting stuff from reference material that could be found in 5 seconds of Googling? Or is there perhaps room for a new close reason to cover this kind of thing? How much hand-holding do we want Stack Overflow's body of work to do?</p> 	How can we improve the situation around recognizable low-level vendor-specific solutions (e.g. on Android)?<p>After two-month development of Android low-level stuff, usually followed by daily visits to SO and certain related groups/forums, I've found an unusually high chance of getting "You are doing what is forbidden"-type answer.</p>  <p>From my point of view: it's my phone, it runs Linux, it can run binaries, it has some 3rdparty code within used to support vendor-specific things like dual-SIM, like injecting audio data to call, a ton of my friends and a billion of other people has same phone model from same vendor, I can open beer bottle with it and lose warranty and don't care, and there is no need to get anything from Play Store...</p>  <p>From the crowd of high-rep specialists: <strong>you are doing not what is allowed in public SDK, thus there is no answer</strong>.</p>  <p>It can be understood that low-level playing with iOS involves a clear violation of EULA (someone said "reverse engineering"?), and Apple is major influencer, trend-setting and taming the young hackers in bulk rates. But Android is open-source, why not to modify anything?</p>  <p>Isn't that clear, that if a major number of people has something that can be modified, a VALID answer for question SHOULD include a detailed description on what can be changed in current codebase to work and what was already done by most popular vendors (HTC? Samsung? all that MTK - THL/Zopo?)</p>  <p>I wonder why any solution/feature request, unofficial to main codebase, is stopped at the point of "not available in the master trunk"?</p>  <p>Samples: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12259378/438039">http://stackoverflow.com/a/12259378/438039</a>; <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/13985100/438039">http://stackoverflow.com/a/13985100/438039</a></p>  <hr>  <p>My point: "unofficial" != "unknown" + "unsupported".

non-duplicate	Does SE have too many badges?<p>It seems to me that there are some good reasons to have badges: making new users aware of the site's functionality / giving them a stake in the site; and incentivizing / rewarding pro-social behavior.  I'll admit that I like getting badges, especially when I was new and when I feel like I've <em>earned</em> them.  However, that doesn't necessarily mean that more badges are always better: there can be diminishing returns, and they could even have a corrupting or disruptive effect in the extreme.  </p>  <p>Under this general heading, I can think of at least three subtopics:  </p>  <ol> <li><p>Should we have badges that people don't want to get?  Do we want to incentivize behavior that doesn't enhance the site?  Some concrete examples:  </p>  <ul> <li>Why on Earth is there a Cleanup badge?  Do people need to be incentivized to rollback edits?  Is this basic site functionality with which new users need to be made aware?   </li> <li>Does anyone want to have a Peer Pressure badge marking for all time that one of their posts was terrible?  </li> <li>How about the Tenacious, Unsung Hero, or Disciplined, are these badges that anyone wants?  Do we want anyone to want these badges or actively pursue them?  </li> <li>These do seem tailor made to induce <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/95918/i-cheated-on-the-disciplined-badge-how-bad-is-it">badge</a> <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/107628/badges-should-reward-positive-behavior">hunting</a>.  </li> <li>I <em>do</em> think there is some value to the Tumbleweed badge:  I often skim the recent badges on the main page to see if there are any nice questions / answers that I have missed, and I sometimes to to tumbleweeds to see if there is something that can be done.  However, I don't know how many people do this, and I wonder if there might be a better system to notify people that a question has been missed than awarding a badge.  </li> </ul></li> <li><p>Do we need badges for things people are going to do anyway?  One concrete example:  </p>  <ul> <li>Why were the new Constable and Sheriff badges created?  I want to be clear that I very much appreciate our moderators and acknowledge their massive, unenviable workload.  But they weren't doing it for these badges; no one expected them.  Moreover, we aren't short of people wanting to be moderators (e.g., there were SO elections a while back with a huge list of candidates).  </li> </ul></li> <li><p>From the perspective that we want to incentivize certain behaviors, the ideal amount of badges is what will lead people to develop good habits and no more.  Anything beyond that will tend to focus those activities towards badge hunting rather than benefiting the site.  Some concrete examples:  </p>  <ul> <li>Why is there still a proofreader badge now that we have a plethora of reviewing badges?  </li> <li>Why does the Analytical badge still exist?  Why not just transform it into the Informed badge, or issue the Analytical badge for reading the about page instead of the FAQ?  </li> <li>Do we need <em>six</em> Stewards?  Why not just one with a complicated rule, like Electorate, where you need a certain minimum in each category and a certain cross-category total?  </li> <li>Here on meta, there seem to be an unending number of questions asking for new badges <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/126297/new-badge-idea-bravery">for</a> <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/116735/gold-sportsmanship-badge">something</a> <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/58982/new-badge-idea-willing-to-sacrifice">or</a> <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1289/new-badge-quick-draw">other</a>, or another level of badges like <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1600/platinum-badges?lq=1">platinum</a> or <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/185275/a-new-harder-type-of-badge">sapphire</a> badges.  These suggest to me that people are more motivated by badges than would be optimal.  </li> </ul></li> </ol>  <p>Some parts of this question have been asked / covered before.  I have tried to include some relevant links to other threads.  But I wanted to put it all together here in one place (perhaps loosely analogous to how <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/67397/">List of all badges with full descriptions</a> brings together information from many other threads).  </p>  <p>It has been argued that <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4760/does-it-matter-that-people-game-badges">it doesn't matter if people game badges</a>.  But it's also been argued that such behavior is disruptive (e.g., see <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/183931/should-the-archaeologist-badge-be-consigned-to-history-or-just-tweaked-a-bit">here</a>).  But another perspective is, if these don't matter, why have them at all?  </p>  <hr>  <p>I'm not against all badges or arguing such.  I think there are several worthwhile categories:  </p>  <ol> <li>New user badges, such as Informed, first vote, edit, etc.  These encourage people to become familiar with site functionality, reify their actions, and by awarding some badges provide a sense of becoming a part of the community and having a stake in it.  As Martha Stewart would say, 'these are good things'.  </li> <li>Badges to incentivize things that need to be done to keep the site functioning smoothly, should be rewarded.  This includes things like Fanatic, Electorate, Copy Editor, Marshal, and perhaps <em>one</em> Steward.  I think we should have just enough to build these habits and <em>no more</em>.  (For example, many users, including I, have voted, edited, reviewed, etc., many more times than were required for the respective badge.)  </li> <li>There very much should continue to be badges that reward excellence.  This includes the nice / popular / favorite question / answer badges, the tag badges, etc.  It seems to me that once someone has been here for a while, this category is where all of their additional badges come from.  </li> </ol>  <p>My suggestion is that there should be a minimum of badges.  Outside of the excellence badges, there should be a few beginner's badges and just enough badges to motivate the behaviors that are necessary for the site to operate smoothly, but no more.  I have no problem with people having hundreds of badges--they should just be for producing excellent content.  The problems I see with possibly having too many badges are: gaming, badge hunting, disruptive behavior, and inflation.  But mostly it's just inconsistent with the site's mission of building a repository of useful knowledge in the form of excellent questions and answers.  </p> 	Consolation badges for hitting the reputation cap hard<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I forgot about the Nice Answer badges that situation almost certainly incurs, ignore this question from now on.</p>  <p>Although I'm on a good way toward an 'Epic' badge on Stack Overflow, I still get a warm fuzzy when I hit the daily reputation cap; that is, if I don't get hit by it too hard. The cap is somewhat frustrating on days with more than 30 or so upvotes, and today (still four and a half hours to go), I stand at 54 upvotes and one accept, for 215 reputation points. I'm not too happy with the cap at the moment.</p>  <p>So I thought it would be a nice consolation if at least there was a badge for suffering hard from the cap, maybe a silver badge (Great Day) for 40 or 50 upvotes on a single day and a gold badge (Awesome Day) for 100 or 150?</p>  <p>Perhaps the count should be limited to answers/questions not older than 7, 14 or 30 days so it's not an automatic badge once you have enough questions and answers overall.</p>  <p>What do you think?</p>  <p>(This is a discussion for the moment; it could become a feature request.)</p>

The question was</p>  <pre><code>    What is the syntax for a for-loop in SQL? </code></pre>  <p>This question got 10 upvotes but the day someone recently asked</p>  <pre><code>    What is the syntax for SELECT statement in SQL? </code></pre>  <p>The question got about 10 downvotes.</p>  <p>Why is this happening?</p> 	Did SO used to have fundamentally different rules about what constituted a good question (see example)?<p>When reviewing whether or not to reopen a question, I came across <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2340566/creating-wizards-for-windows-forms-in-c-sharp">creating wizards for windows forms in C#</a>.

So, are all questions equal, but some are more equal than others?

I got several replies, including some that address to a tee what my botched title actually asks.  My dilemma now is that, if on the one hand I accept one of these replies, I close off the opportunity to get an answer to what I really wanted to ask.  On the other hand, changing the title of the question (and hence, in a way, the question being asked as well) seems shabby to those who took the time to reply.</p>  <p>I know from experience, both writing and replying to this sort of post, that choosing a good title is often tricky, and not easy to get right the first time.  Therefore, I imagine that situations like this one are common in a site like Stack Overflow.  What's considered the proper way to handle such a situation?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>  <p>PS: FWIW, the post I'm referring to is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7005323">stackoverflow.com&#47;questions&#47;7005323</a>.  For the title to <em>really</em> reflect what I'm asking, it would have to be something like, "How to salvage either the zip(*[iter(x)]*n) trick or the map(None, *[iter(x)]*n) trick when n % k > 0?" but this title seems to me way too long (isn't it?).  Also, I'm sure it would be cryptic to most Python programmers, since these tricks are rarely mentioned in replies to questions on evenly "chunking" a list, but I think I will have to accept this: my question <em>is</em> arcane, so no <em>accurate</em> title could fail to be arcane as well. Therefore, for me now it's a toss up between the following titles:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>How to salvage Python's <code>zip(*[iter(x)]*n)</code> trick when n % k > 0?<br>   How to salvage Python's <code>map(None, *[iter(x)]*n)</code> trick when n % k > 0?</p> </blockquote> 
duplicate	Autoformat and autoindent source code<p>Some text editors (emacs, vim, etc) have an "autoindent" feature, where you can select the entire code and indent it perfectly (e.g. by pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> for emacs, or <kbd>=</kbd> for vim).</p>  <p>Since there is an abundance of badly formatted code in SO, would it be possible to have a feature where you select the entire code and press a button to auto-indent it?

non-duplicate	Comment box on mobile doesn't span the width available<p>So I have an HTC Titan which runs on Windows Phone 7.5 and I noticed that when trying to leave a comment, the comment boxes behave differently in some circumstances.  Yes I know, <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/71208">WP7 isn't officially supported yet</a> but I see the same thing in on an iPhone 4S running iOS 5 which <em>is</em> supported but still shows the same behavior.</p>  <p>As far as I can tell, with the phone held horizontally in the landscape orientation, the comment boxes do not span the entire width of the screen when adding the first comment on a post.  It stays about the width of the screen as if it were still being held vertically in the portrait orientation.  Otherwise when adding another comment with other existing comments, it spans the entire width available as I would have expected.  In portrait orientation, they seem to span the expected width in both cases, even if I change orientations after everything has loaded.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yeKMH.jpg" alt="for a first comment"><br> <em>when posting the first comment</em></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3R3ws.jpg" alt="for an additional comment"> <em>when posting an additional comment</em></p>  <p>That can't be by design right?</p> 	Can we make /suggested-edits an actual page?<p>Currently, <code>/suggested-edits/ID</code> links us to an individual suggested edit record for posterity and allows us to audit our fellow users' work.</p>  <p>With that in mind, could we make <code>/suggested-edits</code> a page in and of itself. We could have it list the fifty most recent suggested edits, something like the following:</p>  <pre> ID    Post                        Editor      Reviewer      Decision ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 123   What is my name?

If you're already intimately familiar with the phenomenon, please skip past the first set of bullet points to where I ask for recommendations.)</p>  <hr>  <p>I think many of us have experienced this on occasion:</p>  <ol> <li><p>You open up a narrow-looking question, usually dealing with some specific error message.  The question probably contains a snippet of <em>sloppy</em> but not quite <em>awful</em> code; code indicating that the author, typically a new/low-rep user, possibly a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2004/03/02/82840.aspx" rel="nofollow">Mort</a>, doesn't really know what he's doing.  I'm not trying to be condescending here, he's probably very intelligent and hardworking, but in this <em>specific</em> case, he's clearly in way over his head.</p></li> <li><p><em>However</em>, as a <em>question</em>, it's not really too bad.  The goal and problem are both clearly stated.  The code is formatted (sort of).  Mort was polite and checked his spelling.  The question looks <em>answerable</em>, although from a rep perspective<sup>*</sup> it's an obvious dead-end, it's had maybe 3 views in the past 30 minutes.</p></li> <li><p>So you decide, <em>you know what, this person took the time to write up the question properly, he deserves an answer</em>, put on your good citizen hat and throw him a bone.  You slog through the ugly code, find the offending line, direct his attention to it and explain why it's wrong and how it needs to be fixed.</p></li> <li><p>Later, he leaves a comment saying that yes, that was indeed the problem and your answer helped him fix it <em>(great!)</em>.  Oh, but, now there's another problem <em>(uh-oh...)</em>. Something else is broken.  After letting out a long sigh, you read the comment and/or edited question, roll up your sleeves, and write up Take 2, hoping that's the end of it.</p></li> <li><p>And of <em>course</em> it's not the end.  Now maybe the error is gone, but it's not doing what it's supposed to.  If you're anything like me, your patience is now starting to wear thin. It's lousy code and you didn't volunteer to help him rewrite his whole app.  And of course, the question still only has 12 views, and nobody has upvoted either the question or your answer, <em>including the person you're helping</em>, so this is turning out to be a genuinely thankless task in all respects.  Welcome to "Family Tech Support", Web 2.0 Edition.</p></li> </ol>  <p><sub>* Which is of course just an arbitrary number that none of us care about. Not <em>really</em>, anyway. Not very <em>much</em>, at least.</sub></p>  <hr>  <p>So, here's where I get to <strong>my</strong> question.  At this point, do you:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Leave a comment, stating as politely as possible that you've done your best to help him answer the original question he asked, and if he has a new problem then he should start a new question?  <em>(I did this once, and actually ended up with an accept, but I felt kind of guilty afterwards, I don't think anybody answered his 2nd question).</em></p></li> <li><p>Bite the bullet and edit your answer a 3rd, 4th, 5th time, however many times it takes to resolve his issue, knowing full well that he may not even remember to accept the answer once you're done? <em>(I may work for free on SO, but that doesn't mean my time is worthless.)</em></p></li> <li><p>Just abandon the question, hoping that it will force Mort to start thinking for himself?</p></li> <li><p>Something else?</p></li> </ul>  <p>I've tried all three of the above and none of them ever quite feel right. I do want to help, but at the same time there are a lot more "lucrative" questions I could be answering. And I don't mind spending a lot of time on an answer either, <em>if</em> the question is interesting or important to me, but debugging is dull work.</p>  <p>I'd prefer not to reference specific questions here; I'm pretty sure that this is a shared experience, and my objective isn't to point fingers at "misbehaving" members.  I'm more looking for some practical advice on how to dig myself out of these pits of despair.</p>  <p>Anybody have any other ideas?</p> 	What to do when the question is updated to make your answer obsolete<p>I looked over the "your question may already be answered" suggestions box and didn't see anything that fit, but I've been known to miss those before so apologies in advance if this has been asked before (I imagined it must have been, but see nothing). </p>  <p>What is the correct action when something like this happens:</p>  <blockquote>   <ul>   <li><p>A question is posted to SO.</p></li>   <li><p>You see a few missing lines of code that are the problem, so you post an answer saying so.</p></li>   <li><p>OP takes the code you've suggested and copies it into their question, along with something like "EDIT: I added this new code and it fixed part of the problem but it still doesn't work."</p></li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>At this point the answer doesn't fit the question anymore; on the surface the answerer looks pretty stupid for saying "add these lines" when the lines were already in the question (as far as new viewers can tell, anyway). I commented to the OP and asked a follow-up question to see if I could figure out the rest of the problem, but no dice on that just yet and in the meantime the answer is sitting there looking silly.</p>  <p>So, what's the proper procedure in this case? Delete the answer? Rollback the question edit? Leave it sitting there as is until we get to the bottom of the problem?

non-duplicate	Improve the description of "not an answer" flag<p>There's a <strong>tl:dr</strong> waaay down at the bottom, though the juicy bits are the most important tbh.  </p>  <p>I <em>didn't</em> understand the approach to using "not an answer" flag. I do now from a discussion with Robert Harvey (<a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/198186/is-it-bad-form-to-answer-a-question-with-a-rhetorical-question/198187?noredirect=1#comment-627876">here</a>) which made it clear.<br> But discussions in Meta should not be needed, and currently it's not clear what Stack wants with the "not an answer" flag from the current name and description of said flag.  </p>  <p>I can possibly see why seasoned users/mods/staff could disagree, but perhaps this is the old familiarity chestnut. Whereby because you know something so clearly and have been familiar with it for so long, you cannot see why someone else wouldn’t know what you do.  </p>  <p>Wouldn't it be beneficial for the flag to be clear to people without the need of an explanation from a hard knock stackie?  </p>  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18991618/validating-and-infix-expression/18991919#18991919">This is the answer that lead to this question:</a></p>  <blockquote>   <p>When you try to process an OPERATOR you look forward 1 element in your token vector. What happens if the OPERATOR you are processing is the last element in your token vector?</p> </blockquote>  <p>While the first sentence is a statement, it "does not attempt to answer the question" (the first sentence of the description in the "not an answer" flag).<br> As the second sentence starts with "What happens if", and ends with a question mark, that is a question, rhetorical or otherwise, it too is "not the answer to the question".<br> As such I felt this answer as a whole was "not an answer".  </p>  <p>And there is a flag named "it is not an answer" and even the description fits using it for this question "it does not attempt to answer the question".  </p>  <p>Please tell me why I would not choose this flag? - Without the foresight of what Stack <em>actually</em> wants from this flag. From the name and description you provide, and in scenarios such as this question where it perfectly fits the flag's name and description, people will choose what has been provided.  </p>  <p>I understand what a Rhetorical question is, and in other places this is fine. But Stack promotes a strict Q&amp;A style, including being strict as to what are not answers.<br> Surely a rhetorical question must be defined as a non-answer?</p>  <blockquote>   <p>A rhetorical question is a figure of speech <strong>in the form of a question</strong> that is asked in order to make a point.   The question, a rhetorical device, is posed not to elicit a specific answer, but rather to encourage the listener to consider a message or viewpoint  </p> </blockquote>  <p>Not only is this by definition "not an answer", it is a question that doesn't even warrant an answer. How can this be passed as an answer on a strict Q&amp;A site?  </p>  <p>This is precisely why I, and I'm sure many others, chose "not an answer" flag as it "does not attempt to answer the question"!  </p>  <p>The other options to flag this are:  </p>  <ul> <li>it is spam</li> <li>it is offensive, abusive, or hate speech</li> <li>it is not an answer</li> <li>it is very low quality</li> <li>other (needs ♦ moderator attention)</li> </ul>  <p>It was not spam and was not offensive or abusive.  It was very low quality, but the description under "low quality" flag option clearly indicates this is not the flag for this scenario (perfect description and this logic should be applied to all other flags).  </p>  <p>So we have "not an answer" and "Other" remaining.  </p>  <p>Robert Harvey♦ stated (as have various others):</p>  <blockquote>   <p>With answers like the one being discussed here, it is better to flag with a custom explanation, and explain why you feel the answer is actively harmful and merits removal  </p> </blockquote>  <p>Why would I waste mine and moderator time writing out an explanation to explain in greater detail what would only be summarised as "not an answer", when there is already a flag for this?  </p>  <p><em>Now</em> I of course know that we don't even use flags for this particular scenario, we use downvotes.<br> This is only due to it not fitting in with Stacks required use of any of the flags.<br> But surely you can see by my explanation above why I was led to use the "not an answer" flag?  </p>  <p>It would be interesting to know how many "not an answer" flags are declined each week.  The total figure wouldn't confirm the reason for the total, so perhaps a rewording of the flag description would be good and then see if that average weekly total went down.  </p>  <p>The flag option "not an answer" is a pretty simple meaning, and it's also quite generic. In fact, it could define most of the other flags as well!  </p>  <p>Robert Harvey♦ stated:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Reserve your "Not an Answer" flags for things like "I have the same problem, has anyone found a solution," "I have a new question, how do you..." and "+1, would read again." For everything else that you still think should be removed, cast a custom moderator flag, and explain why  </p> </blockquote>  <p>This is fine, and now it's explained if that's what Stack wants I can act as such, but no-one can know this from the current flag description which is nothing like what Robert explained.  </p>  <p>So if the flag "not an answer" is not to explicitly be used for answers which are not answers by any old definition, and only the definition that Stack doesn't tell the users about, and as this does leave it open to personal interpretation, what Robert described most certainly should be implemented into the flag description, if not the name somehow too.  </p>  <p>The "not an answer" flag name and description:  </p>  <blockquote>   <p>it is not an answer<br>   This was posted as an answer, but it does not attempt to answer the question. It should possibly be an edit, a comment, another question, or deleted altogether.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Breaking that down to how users would interpret it who are not familiar with how Stack want it to be used:  </p>  <ul> <li><em>it is not an answer</em> - is very generic and could even define some of the other flags;</li> <li><em>This was posted as an answer</em> - yes it was it's in the "answers" area;</li> <li><em>it does not attempt to answer the question</em> - again so very generic and also this could define some the other flags;</li> <li><em>It should possibly be an edit, a comment, another question, or deleted altogether.</em> - This is just a list of potential resulting actions from the previous sentence. As the previous sentence and name are generic and not clear cut, and the resulting actions are generic, this does not clearly define how the flag should be used either.</li> </ul>  <p>If it's for things like <em>"I have the same problem, has anyone found a solution," "I have a new question, how do you..." and "+1, would read again."</em>, why not state that in with the flag description?  </p>  <p>This confusion is only worsened by frustration that from my trying to help out with the poorly worded tools provided, I receive "flags should only be used to make moderators aware of content that requires their intervention".<br> This is why I'm provide with the flag buttons, and was provided with a "not an answer" flag to mark this question which was clearly "not an a answer".  </p>  <p>Even if this response is based on a choice from only a few mods have, it shouldn't have been declined with the way the current flag is worded.<br> Even if I'd used the "other" flag, clearly in this case it would have returned the same declined message, as would any other flag. As Stack's way is, any answer which is not spam, offensive or "poor quality" (based on "poor quality" flag's well worded description) shouldn't be flagged and should just be downvoted.  </p>  <p>This is fine, I actually agree completely it is the best method as downvotes just push it down and hopefully get it improved... but you gotta explain more clearly how you want them to be used.  </p>  <p>The wiki for this flag is well worded and explains it much better. Alas "viewed 40 times".  </p>  <p><strong>tl;dr from here</strong><br> The "not an answer" flag name and description is far too generic for people to know how to use it properly. There are many things that are "not an answer" including some of the other flags!  </p>  <p><strong>To the point</strong><br> My feature-request is a change to the "not an answer" flag description and/or name, to more closely resemble what Stack requires it to be used for.  </p>  <p>How about:  </p>  <blockquote>   <p>it is not an answer<br>   for answers such as "I have the same problem..", "I have a new question, how do you..." and "+1 this is great". For "bad" answers just downvote.</p> </blockquote>  <p>And at the top of the pop-up flag list:  </p>  <blockquote>   <p>If the answer you're flagging is just a "bad" answer, or does not match any of the below descriptions, or you feel flagging a moderator using "other" is not justified, simply downvote it</p> </blockquote> 	Can't vote to close on a specific question<p>I tried to vote to close <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16861973/a-class-i-wrote-seem-not-to-access-some-private-fields-of-another-class-that-are">this question</a>.</p>  <p>I got this close page :</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2E8U6.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>As you can see, I can't choose a close reason, or do anything except clicking the <code>x</code>.

duplicate	After 60 days with no activity, a question should automatically become protected<p>I've been seeing a lot of really old questions being bumped to the front page because a person who most likely found the question on google answers "Yeah me too". </p>  <p>These are two examples:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/167870/how-print-the-design-view">How print the design view?</a></li> <li><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/280486/only-solid-color-possible-as-background-in-windows-7">Only solid color possible as background in Windows 7</a></li> </ul>  <p>I'm sure there are more.

The reason I found it is that a 1 rep user had just added an answer.  I didn't notice the date at first, and added my own answer as well.  This isn't a huge deal for one question, but what about the general case?  Does it make sense that any question over, say, a year (or even just six months) should be automatically protected?</p>  <p>I know technology changes and we want the ability to keep older questions up to date, but remember that protecting a question only locks it for users with a small rep.  </p>  <p>What about including views as part of the equation?  A question that earns a "Popular Question" badge is probably getting enough views from low rep users to really need protection and enough views from higher rep users to get the edit and new answer attention when needed, but lower view questions maybe either don't need the protection or do need the edit/answer help from anyone who does happen to land at the question.</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong><br> For context, here is a link to a query that shows actual answers that would have been blocked under this proposal, so we can judge the typical quality.  Note that to accurately judge this you have to view them in the context of answers that are already available to the question at the time the answer is added: <a href="http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/q/93288/" rel="nofollow">http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/q/93288/</a></p>  <p>And here is a query to show how many questions would be effected:<br> <a href="http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/q/93289/" rel="nofollow">http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/q/93289/</a><br> Notethat this is a naive query: it only checks answer count rather than whether the answer has an upvote, and there's no way right now to know how many of these are already protected.  Using the current data set, the result is 114039, or a little less than 1/10th of all questions, and because of the other limitations it's probably even smaller.</p>

Feedback welcome.</em></p>  <p>The idea is to offer a customised review queue to allow volunteers to carry out any campaign to review and fix StackExchange questions and answers.</p>  <p>There are many examples of such a campaign:</p>  <ul> <li>Splitting an ambiguous tag into two.</li> <li>Removing "Thanks" messages and "Please Help".</li> <li>Fixing posts with short titles</li> <li>Cleaning up your very least favourite spelling error.</li> <li>Finding and removing particular curse words.</li> <li>Chasing down spam</li> <li>Inlining exposed URLs</li> </ul>  <p>There are plenty of site-specific rules. Ask people about their pet peeves and get more ideas.</p>  <p>(I can think of several for Skeptics.SE where I am a mod - e.g. old, downvoted posts with post-notices.)</p>  <p>Some campaigns are bigger than a single motivated volunteer. The goal of this feature is to herd the volunteers so that they can co-operate effectively at these campaigns - efficiently allocating reviewers' eyeballs to look at those posts.</p>  <p>There are basically two pages: Configuring a campaign and Reviewing.</p>  <h2>Configuring a Campaign</h2>  <p>Anyone could configure a campaign.</p>  <p>A campaign is configured with a name and linked to a particular StackExchange site.</p>  <p>It is configured with a sets of instructions explaining to reviewers what they are looking for, and what actions they should take if they find an offending post.</p>  <p>The key part of the campaign is a query - which would be predefined in the Data Explorer - which returns all of the posts that need to be reviewed. </p>  <p>There are several types of campaign:</p>  <h3>Single Shot versus Ongoing</h3>  <p>They may be single-shot or ongoing. </p>  <p>A single-shot campaign would be to deal with a problem with old posts. Once the existing items have been reviewed, the campaign can stop. </p>  <p>An ongoing campaign is one where new posts will also need reviewing - the query must be re-run periodically, and volunteers continuously persuaded to review new items.</p>  <h3>Eradication versus Inspection</h3>  <p>It may be an eradication campaign or an inspection campaign. </p>  <p>An eradication campaign is used when the data query can reliably detect offending posts. The posts will continue to be reviewed by volunteers until someone edits them so they no longer appear in the query.</p>  <p>An inspection campaign is used when the data query can only hint at posts that might need editing.</p>  <p>Inspection campaigns have a goal that each post will either (a) be edited until it is eradicated, or (b) be seen by sufficient eyeballs that it is accepted as legitimate.</p>  <p>Inspection campaigns are configured with the number of people who must review a post before it is considered legitimate.</p>  <p><em>The next requirement assumes that it is possible to authenticate a user against a StackExchange site, which I haven't looked into, technically. Note: Despite being authenticated, there is no attempt to (a) make any edits - or even any reads - on behalf of the user, (b) no details, except the user id, current rep and moderator status need be known, and only the user id need be stored.</em></p>  <p>Inspection campaigns may be configured with:</p>  <ul> <li>The number (possibly N/A) of unauthenticated users.</li> <li>The number (possibly N/A) of authenticated users.</li> <li>The number (possibly N/A) of users with at least 10,000 rep (say).</li> <li>The number of moderators.</li> </ul>  <p>A campaign might, for example, declare that review by one moderator is sufficient, or alternatively review by two trusted users, or alternatively review by five non-trusted users, but unauthenticated users should not be counted.</p>  <p>For eradication campaigns, there is no need to authenticate the user in any way.</p>  <h2>Publicising the Campaign</h2>  <p>Once a campaign is configured, a URL is generated to link to the campaign.</p>  <p>The campaign may be a solo campaign, used only by the person who created it to track their work.</p>  <p>Alternatively, the campaign may be advertised in various out-of-scope channels (e.g. chat rooms), providing any volunteers with the URL.</p>  <h2>Reviewing</h2>  <p>Visiting the URL will display information about how campaigns work, and the particular instructions for this campaign.</p>  <p>It should also display any progress made through the campaign (e.g. 35% complete). If the campaign is complete, this should be indicated.</p>  <p>For incomplete campaigns, the key item provided is a link to a StackExchange post for reviewing - a post that is still appearing in the query and has not had enough eyeballs (in the case of inspection campaigns).</p>  <p>While a click on the link should be recorded (as a review for Inspection campaigns), there's no attempt to record what actions, if any, were taken on the StackExchange site. There is no attempt to, for example, take the majority view as in the StackExchange review queue.</p>  <p>Users should have the option to "undo" a visit - i.e. acknowledge that they did not perform a review, and the review count should be duly decremented for that post.</p>  <h2>Conclusion</h2>  <p>This is a feature I would love to see. I think it targets too few people to be of interest to the StackExchange team (happy to be proven wrong), but could be implemented as a fairly straightforward external site - maybe with some ads to cover the hosting.</p>  <p>Happy to chat with anyone interested in implementing it. I would strongly encourage anyone thinking of doing so to check the Terms and Conditions, and consult with the StackExchange Inc. I can't imagine any reason they might object, but they have better imaginations than me.</p> 	Can area51 go in the list of related sites at the bottom of the page?<p>I knew I'd signed up but had a brain fade moment and couldn't remember the name. I had to come here and browse likely looking questions until I found the name of the site!</p>  <p>A link on the bottom of the pages of the other sites in the family would be great. </p>

Shouldn't there be a need for this close reason on many (most?) SE sites? I first thought that the close reason "primarily opinion-based" could be interpreted to cover this, but it is clearly aimed to discourage general discussion-style questions without a well defined answer. At Biology SE this problem often comes up on "controversial" issues such as evolution and parts of human biology, where some questions are ideologically based and built on flawed premises, and where the OP refuses to modify the phrasing of their question to make it answerable. I can imagine that this problem could come up in many science-based SE-sites. An alternative would naturally be to include this as a custom close reason on some SE sites, but if it is relevant for many sites this seems a bit redundant. The old close reason "Not a real question" was actually a better fit for this problem, but still not perfect.</p>  <p>In the discussion I'm referring to above, one example/suggestion for the close reason was given (as a starting point for discussion):</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The premise of your question relies on factually incorrect information, and thus, your question cannot be answered in its current form.</p> </blockquote>  <p>To be clear, the initial aim should always be to improve questions with constructive comments. The main use of this close reason would be situations where the OP is not really interested in honest discussion and a scientifically based Q&amp;A. Thoughts?</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong>: Based on the comments, I want to clarify that the point of this close reason would not be to discourage controversial issues and a broad range of topics. The main use should be to close questions that superficially are phrased as valid within the topic area of a site, but that go against basic principes or ignore fundamental knowledge. A Q&amp;A is hardly the place to challenge e.g. basic evolutionary theory with an argument based on factual mistakes. However, the current close reasons might be sufficient and I appreciate the discussion.  </p>  <p><strong>Note</strong>: This question is inspired by a discussion over <a href="http://meta.biology.stackexchange.com/a/438">custom close reasons at Biology SE</a>, and was first posted as a answer to <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/184154/closing-changes-on-hold-unclear-too-broad-opinion-based-off-topic-reasons/186463?noredirect=1#comment575267_186463">Closing changes: [on hold...]</a>. I thought that it might be more useful as a separate discussion, therefore the reposting.</p>

duplicate	Show the post's comments on the "Suggested Edits" review interface<p>Having recently reviewed a few suggested edits, I've found that not being able to see the comments on the post is hindering my understanding of the context of some edits.</p>  <p>In particular, there have been a few posts where someone has made a substantial edit to a question or answer which significantly alters its meaning. Typically I'd reject that as "too radical", since it can't be known that the new meaning of the post was what the original author intended.</p>  <p>However, in some cases it is clear from the comments that the original author is aware of the intended change, and as such the editor is not in fact misrepresenting the author's intentions. In these cases, it would have been useful to see the comments when making the review decision.</p>  <p>As an example, a common cause of this is when an inexperienced user is asked to clarify their question, and ends up writing a comment that would be better off as an edit to the question (due to length, excess code content, etc), presumably due to lack of awareness that the question can be edited. Often, other users will helpfully edit the question to include the information the OP put in the comment (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/1592760">here</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/1606513">here</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/1623088">here</a> for examples). In this situation, it is clear that the edit reflects the OP's intentions, but this information is <em>only</em> present in the comments which are not visible in the review interface.</p>  <p>Following is the <strong>suggested edit</strong> screen showing the suggested edit. It seems indentation is increased and <strong>one line is moved a few lines upwards</strong> and some empty lines added to increase readability. But it look like an invalid edit since changing the related line may cause alteration on the runtime. So not looks lie a valid edit. Better <em>open the answer and examine it</em></p>  <blockquote>   <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HBpJv.png" alt=""></p> </blockquote>  <p>Checking the Q&amp;A itself reveals that a talk had taken place between the OP and the answerer and <strong>revision done by the OP with the permission of the answerer</strong>. <em>So it was indeed a valid edit.</em></p>  <blockquote>   <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SIqYC.png" alt=""></p> </blockquote>  <p>In short: is there any particular reason comments are not displayed in the suggested edit review interface? I think it would add useful contextual information when making review decisions, and presumably this would be trivial to implement.</p>  <p>Note: this is not a dupe of <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/76682">this post</a>, as it does not concern comments posted <em>after</em> the suggested edit.</p> 	Have suggested edits also show the comments to a post<p>Some suggested edits like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/suggested-edits/2726595">this one</a> at first look like another user trying to hijack a question. Until you see the suggestion's comment stating "Added code snippet provided by OP" - but anyone could claim that, so now you have to open the question in a new tab to check for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18228687/jq-grid-beforecheckvalues-return-type#comment26762895_18228687">referred to provision</a>. I therefore propose that comments are also viewable directly in the edit review view.</p> 
non-duplicate	Where should I post product development/release questions?<p>I'm pretty sure product development or release questions aren't allowed on Stack Overflow, if I understood correctly. But I was wondering, where could I ask a question and get an appropriate answer with subject matter pertaining to the production and release of projects, and moving a project through the production stages?</p> 	Another kind of Disciplined badge<p>I often see a trivial question I can answer in about a minute, but since it's so easy, it <em>must have been</em> asked before, right? So I'm faced with a choice:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Find the existing question and vote to close the new one as duplicate. This would benefit the site, driving all users with the same question to one place.</p></li> <li><p>Answer it immediately, quite possibly collecting a couple of votes, at the expense of adding to the clutter, fragmentation on the site.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Searching for duplicates is tedious and unrewarding. I have to copy and paste the question or type it rephrased. Then read a couple of possible duplicates, and maybe even repeat the search. There may not even be a worthy existing question. In short, it's far more rewarding to just answer.</p>  <p>This happens to me a lot. And every time, I have the distinct feeling that it really takes <strong>discipline</strong> to do the right thing and search first. A badge would be nice for this! Those folks who do take the time and effort to find duplicates and get them closed deserve a reward.</p>  <p><em>PS: As for the current meaning of the Disciplined badge, I hardly ever feel that I would exercise discipline by deleting my own upvoted answer. On the other hand, the urge to answer instead of searching happens to me pretty much every day, and I'm a pretty casual user, far from a fanatic.</em></p> 
duplicate	Should Spam posts be edited?<p>I noticed that the posts of the recent spam surge on AskUbuntu were all edited by community members into something like</p>  <blockquote>   <p>EDITED - REMOVED SPAM ANSWER</p> </blockquote>  <p>or similar.</p>  <p>While I understand why the users have done this and I too don't want to leave the spam content visible for longer than absolutely necessary, it made flagging more time consuming for me.</p>  <p>I had to check the revision for every of those possible spam posts to check if it is actually spam, instead of being able to flag directly from the review site. Spam flags carry a serious penalty, I'm not willing to add my spam flag without checking that it's really spam.</p>  <p>I see the benefit of editing spam, but it also causes some more effort for the later flaggers.

non-duplicate	Help reviewing and cleaning up accept rate comments<p>I've been wading through SO comments mentioning 'accept rate' and cleaning up where appropriate.  But following the recent SE data explorer refresh, the number outstanding has exceed 5 000 and I'm not sure the <a href="http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/s/2176/candidate-obsolete-comments-mentioning-accept-rate" rel="nofollow">query I'm using</a> is catching most or just some of them.</p>  <p>I'd say around 50% of the candidates - perhaps more - warrant deletion.  The problem though is the sheer number.  I can only flag around 50 or so a day, and from September 2011 there are around 20-60 candidates from each day.  Often a post will have a number of other off-topic or obsolete comments that need flagging.  I can't keep up.</p>  <p>Flagging accept rate comments is quite satisfying - they are instantly deleted.

Couldn't it be implied by the WPF tag that both C# code and xaml code should be highlighted, or should I just continue to add the C# tag to questions if I have any C# in my answer?</p> 	Should moderators be able to see who flags a comment?<p>Background, elaborating on <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2832/details-about-the-flagging-mechanism">my answer here</a>:</p>  <p>There are 3 queues of flags:</p>  <ul> <li>Comment Flags</li> <li>Moderator Flags (where you type in the little message)</li> <li>Spam/Offensive (That 10K Users can see)</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Moderator Flags</strong> These flags have your name attached to them, let you write a message, and are the only ones to set off the mod-signal (the red box in the toolbar)</p>  <p><strong>Comment Flags</strong> These flags <em>do not</em> show who flags an item.  It shows the # of flags a comment has, its up-vote score, the question thread, comment, author, and built-in links to clear flags and delete comment. (Personally, I never delete a comment without visiting the thread to review all comments)</p>  <p><strong>Spam/Offensive</strong> I won't bother describing this in detail since most of you have 10K rep on some site, but the only difference for a mod is we can clear the flags on an item.</p>  <p>Now, on Meta, we get a lot of flags on comments that make absolutely no sense to me.  It's obvious there's nothing offensive about the comment.  Usually the comment is disagreeing with someone.  My assumption (which I never act on because it's unverified) is that whoever is being disagreed with is flagging the comment.</p>  <p>Frankly, I consider this to be abusing the system and even-moreso <em>bloody annoying</em>.  Having to sort through a bunch of comment threads to see if something is worse than it appears in the actual comment takes time.  If someone continually flagged items with write-ins on obviously-fine items, I would tell them to stop.  </p>  <p>My question is - should Moderators be able to see who flags comments?</p>  <p>I can understand you may be concerned that, by knowing who is flagging the item, we would take sides with or against that person.  I don't have a magic potion that would prevent that, just my track record and honesty.  As Bill said:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I think we're all mature enough to not   try and get retribution against   someone for flagging it. We were all   chosen as moderators (many of us by   community vote) at least in part for   this reason.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I think with the ability, we'd be able to sort out troublemakers quickly/more efficiently, and (hopefully) show users that we expect them to be more mature and not go flagging everyone who disagrees with them.  I expect it would also reduce the time it takes to wade through comment threads by seeing if it's just A &amp; B butting heads again.</p>  <p><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/15961/will-a-moderator-know-if-i-flag-them">Related Thread - Will a moderator know if I flag them?</a></p>  <p>This is just my take on it, from Meta.

non-duplicate	Is there a way to go directly to chat through commens?<p>I have noticed that when you are exchanging comments with someone under an answer, and reach a certain number of comments, you are opted to start a chat instead. Is it possible to initiate this right away? If not, could you make it possible?</p>  <p>My example of when this could be nice to have is this: I wrote a general answer to a question about Hibernate, and after some time someone asked a quite specific question in a comment underneath my answer. I would like to help out, but still it would be nice not to clutter my general answer with very specific comments. In this case I would have liked to just initiate a chat with the person asking right away, and then avoid a long comment conversation that really is quite irrelevant to the actual answer.</p> 	You can vote to close two questions as duplicates of each other<blockquote>   <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>   <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/54024/prevent-circular-close-as-exact-duplicate-loop">Prevent circular close as exact duplicate loop</a>  </p> </blockquote>    <p>As I demonstrated with these two questions:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/61559/can-a-question-be-a-duplicate-of-a-duplicate-of-itself">http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/61559/can-a-question-be-a-duplicate-of-a-duplicate-of-itself</a></li> <li><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/61562/can-a-question-be-a-duplicate-of-a-duplicate-of-itself">http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/61562/can-a-question-be-a-duplicate-of-a-duplicate-of-itself</a></li> </ul>  <p>You can vote to close two questions as duplicates of each other.</p>

It was clearly not a crap answer, and I could tell it was probably an audit because no username was being displayed, but I wanted to read the question before deciding whether to "no action" or "skip". The question had slightly fuddled grammar so I decided to look at its comments. The comment expansion text read "show 8 more comments" (all 8 comments were hidden). I clicked it and it failed the audit.</p>  <p>Why should an audit based on a known good answer fail because I was attempting to get more information on the question?</p>  <p>Interestingly enough, several non-audit reviews I've seen replace the "add comment"/"show more comments" link with the text "comments disabled on deleted / locked posts / reviews". At the very least this text should have shown for this audit.</p> 	Review Audit Honeypot Bug<p>Related to: <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/152709/131956">Improving the Quality of Reviews: Project Honeypot</a></p>  <hr>  <p>[This has actually happened to me on two separate occassions.]</p>  <ul> <li>While reviewing, I came across <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/close/2665371">a question</a> that looked legitimate.</li> <li>I noticed a comment from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/102937/robert-harvey">@Robert Harvey</a>, and I wanted to understand the point that he was making.</li> <li>Within my Google Chrome browser, I right-clicked on the link and selected 'Open link in new tab.'</li> <li>I actually agreed with Robert's comment (that the linked post was related) but also felt that the "honeypot" was a legitimate question.</li> <li>But when I returned to the review task, I saw the 'STOP!

duplicate	Enlightened badge clarification<p>For the <code>first answer criterion</code> for the Enlightened badge, is the first answer the one</p>  <ul> <li>that remains, excluding deleted answers; or</li> <li>that ever was, including deleted answers</li> </ul>  <p>As for the suggestion, if it were the latter, can we please make it the former?  It would make sense to exclude squatters from the equation if they later retract their answer from the question (having reached no good solution).</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong> - ChrisF has posted convincing proof that it is the former, so - great stuff, SE!</p> 	Enlightened badge - first overall answer or among those not deleted?<p>The definition of the Enlightened badge says:</p>  <blockquote>   <h3>Enlightened</h3>      <ul>   <li>silver; awarded multiple times</li>   <li>Be the first person to answer a question, and receive a score of at least ten for that answer.
